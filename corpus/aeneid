a

as
neither

how
this
may
be
performd
now
take
my

ascanius
by
his

is
designd
to
come
with

laden
from

to
gratify
the

gain

the

deceit
may
pass
unseen
and
none
prevent
the

take
thou
his

i
beg
the

but
only
for
a
nights
revolving

thyself
a

assume
a
boys
dissembled
face
that
when
amidst
the
fervor
of
the
feast
the
tyrian
hugs
and
fonds
thee
on
her
breast
and
with
sweet
kisses
in
her
arms
constrains
thou
mayst
infuse
thy
venom
in
her

the
god
of
love
obeys
and
sets
aside
his
bow
and
quiver
and
his
plumy
pride
he
walks
iulus
in
his

sight
and
in
the
sweet
resemblance
takes
delight
the
goddess
then
to
young
ascanius
flies
and
in
a
pleasing
slumber
seals
his

lulld
in
her

amidst
a

of

she
gently
bears
him
to

then
with

crowns
his

what

renews
the

remembrance
of
our

an

from
its

foundations
rent

evry
woe
the
trojans
underwent
a
peopled
city
made
a

place
all
that
i

part
of
which
i
was
not

of

the

since
you
take
such
intrest

our
woe
and
troys
disastrous
end
desire
to
know
i
will
restrain
my
tears
and
briefly
tell
what
in
our
last
and
fatal
night
befell
by
destiny
compelld
and
in
despair
the
greeks
grew
weary
of
the
tedious
war
and
by
minervas
aid
a
fabric
reard
which
like
a
steed
of
monstrous
height
appeard
the

were
plankd
with
pine
they
feignd
it
made
for
their
return
and
this
the
vow
they
paid
thus
they
pretend
but
in
the
hollow
side
selected
numbers
of
their
soldiers
hide
with
inward
arms
the
dire
machine
they
load
and
iron
bowels
stuff
the
dark
abode
in

of
troy
lies
tenedos
an
isle
while
fortune
did
on
priams
empire
smile
renownd
for
wealth
but
since
a
faithless
bay
where
ships
exposd
to
wind

weather
lay
there
was
their
fleet
conceald
we
thought
for
greece
their
sails
were
hoisted
and
our
fears
release
the
trojans
coopd
within
their
walls
so
long
unbar
their
gates
and
issue
in
a
throng
like
swarming
bees
and
with
delight
survey
the

the

aloud
o

the

then
a

left

could
not
bear
his

with
silent
grief

loudly
blamd
the
state
and
cursd
the
direful
author
of
my

t

told
again

hence
my

his

th

from

why

this
fair
unfinishd
tale
these
broken

raisd
expectations
in
our
longing
hearts
unknowing
as
we
were
in
grecian
arts
his
former
trembling
once
again
renewd
with
acted
fear
the
villain
thus
pursued
long
had
the
grecians
tird
with
fruitless
care
and
wearied
with
an
unsuccessful
war
resolvd
to
raise
the

withstood
their

home

changd

amazd

most
when
this

then
flaming
meteors
hung

were

with

your

be
bought
again

for
twice
five
days
the

withstood
th

and
was
dumb
to

till
tird
with
endless

and
pursuit
of

he
stood
no

as

fled

all

i
lay
secure
of

now
what

to
see
my

again
my
tender
infants
or
my
careful
sire
whom
they
returning

perpetrate

their

from

to

no

t

troy

androgeos
fell

my

this
long

you
loiter
while

away
our

are
laden
with

ashore

he
said
but
soon
corrected
his
mistake
found
by
the
doubtful
answers
which
we
make
amazd
he
would
have
shunnd
th
unequal
fight
but
we
more
numrous
intercept
his
flight
as
when
some
peasant
in
a
bushy
brake
has
with
unwary
footing
pressd
a
snake
he
starts
aside
astonishd
when
he
spies
his
rising

rolling

so
from

surprisd
androgeos
flies
in

for

and
his
we

possessd
with

unknowing

of

an

with

of

this

fatally
designd
my

said
he
since
fortune
shows
the
way
t
is

we
should
th
auspicious
guide
obey
for
what
has
she
these
grecian
arms
bestowd

their
destruction

good
then
change
we
shields
and
their
devices
bear
let
fraud
supply
the
want
of

in

they
find

this
said
himself
he
dressd
in
dead
androgeos
spoils
his
upper
vest
his
painted
buckler
and
his
plumy
crest
thus
ripheus
dymas
all
the
trojan
train
lay
down
their
own
attire
and
strip
the
slain
mixd
with
the
greeks
we
go
with
ill
presage
flatterd
with
hopes
to
glut
our
greedy
rage
unknown
assaulting
whom
we
blindly
meet
and
strew
with
grecian
carcasses
the
street
thus
while
their
straggling
parties
we
defeat
some
to
the
shore
and
safer
ships
retreat
and
some
oppressd
with
more
ignoble
fear
remount
the
hollow
horse
and
pant
in
secret
there
but
ah
what
use
of
valor
can
be
made
when
heavns
propitious
powrs
refuse
their
aid
behold
the
royal
prophetess
the
fair
cassandra
draggd
by
her
disheveld
hair
whom
not
minervas
shrine
nor
sacred
bands
in

could
protect
from
sacrilegious

on

she
cast
her

she
sighd
she
cried
t
was
all
she
could
her
tender
arms
were
tied
so
sad
a
sight
coroebus
could
not
bear
but
fird
with
rage
distracted
with
despair
amid
the
barbrous
ravishers
he
flew
our

we
pursue

storms
of
stones
from
the
proud

height
pour
down
and
on

alight
we
from

receivd
this
fatal
blow
who
thought

as
we
seemd
in

they
aim
at
the
mistaken

from

ours
beneath
the
pondrous

lie
then
movd
with
anger
and
disdain

dispersd
the
royal

free
the
grecians
rally
and
their

unite
with
fury
charge
us
and
renew
the
fight
the

kings
with

join
their

thus
when

of

south
east

on
airy

he
creeps
along
with

despairing
of

ambitious
to

by

there
stood
in

an
altar
near
the
hearth
a
laurel
grew
dodderd
with
age
whose
boughs
encompass
round
the
household
gods
and
shade
the
holy
ground
here
hecuba
with
all
her
helpless
train
of
dames
for
shelter
sought
but
sought
in
vain
drivn
like
a
flock
of
doves
along
the

their
images
they
hug
and
to
their
altars
fly
the
queen
when
she
beheld
her
trembling
lord
and
hanging
by
his
side
a
heavy
sword
what
rage

she
cried
has
seizd
my

mind
what

are
these
and
to
what

designd
these

want

were
hector

evn

now
in

she
said
and
with
a
last
salute
embracd
the
poor
old
man
and
by
the
laurel
placd
behold
polites
one
of
priams
sons
pursued
by
pyrrhus
there
for
safety
runs
thro
swords
and
foes
amazd
and
hurt
he
flies
thro
empty

and
open

him
pyrrhus
urging
with
his
lance
pursues
and
often
reaches
and
his
thrusts
renews
the
youth
transfixd
with
lamentable
cries
expires
before
his
wretched
parents
eyes
whom
gasping
at
his
feet
when
priam
saw
the
fear
of
death
gave
place
to
natures
law
and
shaking
more
with
anger
than
with
age
the
gods

said
he
requite
thy
brutal
rage
as
sure
they
will
barbarian
sure
they
must
if
there
be
gods
in
heavn
and
gods
be
just
who
takst
in

an
insolent
delight
with
a
sons
death
t
infect
a

sight
not
he
whom
thou
and
lying
fame
conspire
to
call
thee
his
not

thy

thus
usd
my
wretched
age
the
gods
he
feard
the
laws
of
nature
and
of
nations
heard
he
cheerd
my
sorrows
and
for
sums
of
gold
the
bloodless
carcass
of
my
hector
sold
pitied
the
woes
a
parent
underwent
and
sent
me
back
in
safety
from
his
tent

this
said
his
feeble
hand
a
javelin
threw
which
fluttring
seemd
to
loiter
as
it
flew
just
and
but
barely
to
the
mark
it
held
and
faintly
tinkled
on
the
brazen
shield
then
pyrrhus
thus
go
thou
from
me
to
fate
and
to
my
father
my
foul
deeds
relate
now
die

with
that
he
draggd
the
trembling
sire
sliddring
thro
clotterd
blood
and
holy
mire
the
mingled
paste
his
murderd
son
had
made
hauld
from
beneath
the
violated
shade
and
on
the
sacred
pile
the
royal
victim
laid
his
right
hand
held
his
bloody
falchion
bare
his
left
he
twisted
in
his
hoary
hair
then
with
a
speeding
thrust
his
heart
he
found
the
lukewarm
blood
came
rushing
thro
the
wound
and
sanguine
streams
distaind
the
sacred
ground
thus
priam
fell
and
shard
one
common
fate
with
troy
in
ashes
and
his
ruind
state
he
who
the
scepter
of
all
asia
swayd
whom
monarchs
like
domestic
slaves
obeyd
on
the
bleak
shore
now
lies
th
abandond
king
a
headless
carcass
and
a
nameless
thing
then
not
before
i
felt
my
cruddled
blood
congeal
with
fear
my
hair
with
horror
stood
my
fathers
image
filld
my
pious
mind
lest
equal
years
might
equal
fortune
find
again
i
thought
on
my
forsaken
wife
and
trembled
for
my
sons
abandond
life
i
lookd
about
but
found
myself
alone
deserted
at
my
need
my
friends
were
gone
some
spent
with
toil
some
with
despair
oppressd
leapd
headlong
from
the
heights
the
flames
consumd
the
rest
thus
wandring
in
my
way
without
a
guide
the
graceless
helen
in
the
porch
i
spied
of
vestas
temple
there
she
lurkd
alone
muffled
she
sate
and
what
she
could
unknown
but
by
the
flames
that
cast
their
blaze
around
that
common
bane
of
greece
and
troy
i
found
for
ilium
burnt
she
dreads
the
trojan
sword
more
dreads
the
vengeance
of
her
injurd
lord
evn
by
those
gods
who
refugd
her
abhorrd
trembling
with
rage
the
strumpet
i
regard
resolvd
to
give
her
guilt
the
due
reward
shall
she
triumphant
sail
before
the
wind
and
leave
in
flames
unhappy
troy
behind
shall
she
her
kingdom
and
her
friends
review
in
state
attended
with
a
captive
crew
while
unrevengd
the
good
old
priam
falls
and
grecian
fires
consume
the
trojan
walls
for
this
the
phrygian
fields
and
xanthian
flood
were
swelld
with
bodies
and
were
drunk
with
blood
t
is
true
a
soldier
can
small
honor
gain
and
boast
no
conquest
from
a
woman
slain
yet
shall
the
fact
not
pass
without
applause
of
vengeance
taken
in
so
just
a
cause
the
punishd
crime
shall
set
my
soul
at
ease
and
murmring
manes
of
my
friends
appease

thus
while
i
rave
a
gleam
of
pleasing
light
spread
oer
the
place
and
shining
heavnly
bright
my
mother
stood
reveald
before
my
sight
never
so
radiant
did
her
eyes
appear
not
her
own
star
confessd
a
light
so
clear
great
in
her
charms
as
when
on
gods
above
she
looks
and
breathes
herself
into
their
love
she
held
my
hand
the
destind
blow
to
break
then
from
her
rosy
lips
began
to
speak
my
son
from
whence
this
madness
this
neglect
of
my
commands
and
those
whom
i
protect
why
this
unmanly
rage
recall
to
mind
whom
you
forsake
what
pledges
leave
behind
look
if
your
helpless
father
yet
survive
or
if
ascanius
or
creusa
live
around
your
house
the
greedy
grecians
err
and
these
had
perishd
in
the
nightly
war
but
for
my
presence
and
protecting
care
not
helens
face
nor
paris
was
in
fault
but
by
the
gods
was
this
destruction
brought
now
cast
your

around
while
i
dissolve
the
mists
and
films
that
mortal
eyes
involve
purge
from
your

the
dross
and
make
you
see
the
shape
of
each
avenging

enlightend
thus
my
just
commands
fulfil
nor
fear
obedience
to
your

where

and
when

while
thus
she
fills
the
house
with
clamrous
cries
our
hearing
is
diverted
by
our
eyes
for
while
i
held
my
son
in
the
short
space
betwixt
our
kisses
and
our
last
embrace
strange
to
relate
from
young
iulus
head
a
lambent
flame
arose
which
gently
spread
around
his
brows
and
on
his
temples
fed
amazd
with
running
water
we
prepare
to
quench
the
sacred
fire
and
slake
his

scarce
had
he
said
when
on
our
left
we
hear
a
peal
of
rattling
thunder
roll
in
air
there
shot
a
streaming
lamp
along
the
sky
which
on
the
winged
lightning
seemd
to
fly
from
oer
the
roof
the
blaze
began
to
move
and
trailing
vanishd
in
th
idaean
grove
it
swept
a
path
in
heavn
and
shone
a
guide
then
in
a
steaming
stench
of
sulphur
died
the
good
old
man
with
suppliant
hands
implord
the
gods
protection
and
their

spilt

thus
ordring
all
that

past
a

we

my

cried

some
hostile
god
for

unknown
offense
had
sure
bereft
my
mind
of
better
sense
for
while
thro
winding
ways
i
took
my
flight
and
sought
the
shelter
of
the
gloomy
night
alas
i
lost
creusa
hard
to
tell
if
by
her
fatal
destiny
she
fell
or
weary
sate
or
wanderd
with
affright
but
she
was
lost
for

i
knew
not
or
reflected
till
i
meet
my
friends
at

now
deserted
seat
we
met
not
one
was
wanting
only
she
deceivd
her
friends
her

and
wretched
me
what
mad
expressions
did
my
tongue
refuse
whom
did
i
not
of

or

accuse
this
was
the
fatal
blow
that
paind
me
more
than
all
i
felt
from
ruind
troy
before
stung
with
my
loss
and
raving
with
despair
abandoning
my
now
forgotten
care
of
counsel
comfort
and
of
hope
bereft
my
sire
my

my
country
gods
i
left
in
shining
armor
once
again
i
sheathe
my
limbs
not
feeling
wounds
nor
fearing
death
then
headlong
to
the
burning
walls
i
run
and
seek
the
danger
i
was
forcd
to
shun
i
tread
my
former
tracks
thro
night
explore
each
passage
evry
street
i
crossd
before
all
things
were
full
of
horror
and
affright
and
dreadful
evn
the
silence
of
the
night
then
to
my

house
i
make
repair
with
some
small
glimpse
of
hope
to
find
her
there
instead
of
her
the
cruel
greeks
i
met
the

filld
with
foes
with

thus
phoebus

my

thus

ye

hear

the

in

lies
with

and
on

a
hundred

stand
another

rises
there
and
we
from
thence
derive
our
trojan
ancestry
from
thence
as
t
is
divulgd
by
certain
fame
to
the
rhoetean
shores
old
teucrus
came
there

and
there
the

then
green

in

with

we
pass
the
scatterd
isles
of
cyclades
that
scarce

the

double
near

they
cry
and
swiftly
thro
the
foamy
billows
fly
full
on

at

we
bore
with
joy
descending

my

bids
me

the

to
learn
what
end
of

we
might
expect

t

night
when
evry

void

majestically

such

cassandra
did
relate
this

revives
within
my

what
she
foretold
of
troy
renewd
in

but
who
could
then
have
thought
that
phrygian

or
who
believd
what
mad
cassandra
taught
now
let
us
go
where
phoebus
leads
the
way

he
said
and
we
with
glad
consent
obey
forsake
the

and
leaving

behind
we
spread
our
sails
before
the
willing
wind
now
from

our

move
with

in

peals
the

no

no

found
betwixt

such

around

the

without

and
three
sunless

the

renews

and
from

we

with

we
landed
at

fat

of
oxen
graze
the
flowry
field
and
wanton
goats
without
a

strayd
with

the

snatch

return

when
along

we
hear

saw

you

if
a

thus
many

upbraid
the
madness
of

with

leave

think
it

invite

beg
the
sacred
priestess
to
relate
with
willing
words
and
not
to
write
thy
fate
the
fierce
italian
people
she
will
show
and
all
thy
wars
and
all
thy
future
woe
and
what
thou
mayst
avoid
and
what
must
undergo
she
shall
direct
thy

instruct
thy

and
teach
thee
how
the
happy
shores
to
find
this
is
what
heavn
allows
me
to
relate

part
in

pursue
thy

the

adorns

fearful
for

my

left
me
forsaken
in
the
cyclops
den
the
cave
tho
large
was
dark
the
dismal
floor
was
pavd
with
mangled
limbs
and
putrid
gore
our
monstrous
host
of
more
than
human
size
erects
his
head
and
stares
within
the
skies
bellowing
his
voice
and
horrid
is
his
hue
ye
gods
remove
this
plague
from
mortal
view
the
joints
of
slaughterd
wretches
are
his
food
and
for
his
wine
he
quaffs
the
streaming
blood
these
eyes
beheld
when
with
his
spacious
hand
he
seizd
two
captives
of
our
grecian
band
stretchd
on
his
back
he
dashd
against
the
stones
their
broken
bodies
and
their
crackling
bones
with
spouting
blood
the
purple
pavement
swims
while
the
dire
glutton
grinds
the
trembling
limbs
not
unrevengd
ulysses
bore
their
fate
nor
thoughtless
of
his
own
unhappy
state
for
gorgd
with
flesh
and
drunk
with
human
wine
while
fast
asleep
the
giant
lay
supine
snoring
aloud
and
belching
from
his
maw
his
indigested
foam
and
morsels
raw
we
pray
we
cast
the
lots
and
then
surround
the
monstrous
body
stretchd
along
the
ground
each
as
he
could
approach
him
lends
a
hand
to
bore
his
eyeball
with
a
flaming
brand
beneath
his
frowning
forehead
lay
his
eye
for
only
one
did
the
vast
frame
supply
but
that
a
globe
so
large
his
front
it
filld
like
the
suns
disk
or
like
a
grecian
shield
the
stroke
succeeds
and
down
the
pupil
bends
this
vengeance
followd
for
our
slaughterd
friends
but
haste
unhappy
wretches
haste
to
fly
your
cables
cut
and
on
your
oars
rely
such
and
so
vast
as
polypheme
appears
a

their

thus
in
woods
and
wilds
obscure
from

i
drag
my
loathsome
days
with
mortal
fright
and
in
deserted
caverns
lodge
by
night
oft
from
the
rocks
a
dreadful
prospect
see
of
the
huge
cyclops
like
a
walking
tree
from
far
i
hear
his
thundring
voice
resound
and
trampling
feet
that
shake
the
solid
ground
cornels
and
salvage
berries
of
the
wood
and
roots
and
herbs
have
been
my
meager
food
while
all
around

longing
eyes
i
cast
i
saw
your
happy
ships
appear
at

on
those
i
fixd
my

to

death

bestow

that
while

continue

beauteous
queen

in

with

adorns

the
ruddy

the

with

invoke

feeds
their

with

with
hourly

the

renews

anxiously
the

what
priestly
rites
alas
what
pious
art
what

avail
to
cure
a
bleeding
heart

reigns
sick
with

seeking
him
she
loves
from

the
raving
dido
roves
so
when
the
watchful
shepherd
from
the
blind
wounds
with
a
random
shaft
the
careless
hind
distracted
with
her
pain
she
flies
the
woods
bounds
oer
the
lawn
and
seeks
the
silent
floods
with
fruitless
care
for
still
the
fatal
dart
sticks
in
her
side
and
rankles
in
her
heart
and
now
she
leads
the
trojan
chief
along
the
lofty
walls
amidst
the
busy
throng
displays
her
tyrian
wealth
and
rising
town
which
love
without
his
labor
makes
his
own
this
pomp
she
shows
to
tempt
her
wandring
guest
her
faltring
tongue
forbids
to
speak
the
rest
when
day
declines
and
feasts
renew
the
night
still
on
his
face
she
feeds
her
famishd
sight
she
longs
again
to
hear
the
prince
relate
his
own
adventures
and
the
trojan
fate
he
tells
it
oer
and
oer
but
still
in
vain
for
still
she
begs
to
hear
it
once
again
the

thus
the
tragic
story
never
ends
then
when
they
part
when

to

invite
she

remains
when

the

with

closd

lands
where
shepherds
once
were
housd
in
homely
sheds
now
towrs
within

advance
their

arriving
there
he

thus
with

all
powrful
jove
who
sways
the

has
sent
me
down
with
this
severe
command
what
means
thy

if

cannot
move
a

so

wear
to
whom
th
ausonian
scepter
and
the

of

imperial
name
is
owd
by
fate
so
spoke
the
god
and
speaking
took
his
flight
involvd
in
clouds
and
vanishd
out
of
sight
the
pious
prince
was
seizd
with
sudden
fear
mute
was
his
tongue
and
upright
stood
his
hair
revolving
in
his
mind
the
stern
command
he
longs
to
fly
and
loathes
the
charming
land
what
should
he
say
or
how
should
he
begin
what
course
alas
remains
to
steer
between
th
offended
lover
and
the
powrful
queen
this
way
and
that
he
turns
his
anxious
mind
and
all
expedients
tries
and
none
can
find
fixd
on
the
deed
but
doubtful
of
the
means
after
long
thought
to
this
advice
he
leans
three
chiefs
he
calls
commands
them
to
repair
the
fleet
and
ship
their
men
with
silent
care
some
plausible
pretense
he
bids
them
find
to
color
what
in
secret
he
designd
himself
meantime
the
softest
hours
would
choose
before
the
love
sick
lady
heard
the
news
and
move
her
tender
mind
by
slow
degrees
to
suffer
what
the
sovreign
powr
decrees
jove
will
inspire
him
when
and
what
to
say
they
hear
with
pleasure
and
with
haste
obey
but
soon
the
queen
perceives
the
thin
disguise
what
arts
can
blind
a
jealous
womans
eyes
she
was
the
first
to
find
the
secret
fraud
before
the
fatal
news
was
blazd
abroad

of
the

evn

with

of

roves

round

the
bacchanalian
dames
appear
when
from
afar
their
nightly
god
they
hear
and
howl
about
the
hills
and
shake
the
wreathy
spear
at
length
she
finds
the
dear
perfidious
man
prevents
his

excuse
and
thus
began
base
and
ungrateful
could
you
hope
to
fly
and
undiscoverd
scape

eye
nor
could
my
kindness
your
compassion
move
nor

deny
with
yon
perfidious
man
your
intrest
try
and
bring
me
news
if
i
must
live
or
die
you
are
his
favrite
you
alone
can
find
the
dark
recesses
of
his
inmost
mind
in
all
his
trusted
secrets
you
have
part
and
know
the
soft
approaches
to
his

haste
then
and
humbly
seek
my
haughty
foe
tell
him
i
did
not
with
the
grecians
go
nor
did
my
fleet
against
his
friends
employ
nor
swore
the
ruin
of
unhappy
troy
nor
movd
with
hands
profane
his
fathers
dust
why
should
he
then
reject
a
suit
so
just
whom
does
he
shun
and
whither
would
he
fly
can
he
this
last
this
only
prayr
deny
let
him
at
least
his
dangrous
flight
delay
wait
better
winds
and
hope
a
calmer
sea
the
nuptials
he
disclaims
i
urge
no
more
let
him
pursue
the
promisd
latian
shore
a
short
delay
is
all
i
ask
him
now
a
pause
of
grief
an
interval
from
woe
till
my
soft
soul
be
temperd
to
sustain
accustomd
sorrows
and
inurd
to
pain
if
you
in

grant
this
one
request

shall
glut
the

all
her

she
comes

still
beating

the

without

this
let
me
crave
since
near
your

the
road
to
hell
lies
open
and
the
dark
abode
which
acheron
surrounds
th
innavigable
flood
conduct
me
thro
the
regions
void
of
light
and
lead
me
longing
to
my
fathers
sight
for
him
a
thousand
dangers
i
have
sought
and
rushing
where
the
thickest
grecians
fought
safe
on
my
back
the
sacred
burthen
brought
he
for
my
sake
the
raging
ocean
tried
and
wrath
of
heavn
my
still
auspicious
guide
and
bore
beyond
the
strength
decrepid
age
supplied
oft
since
he
breathd
his
last
in
dead
of
night
his
reverend
image
stood
before
my
sight
enjoind
to
seek
below
his
holy
shade
conducted
there
by
your
unerring
aid
but
you
if
pious
minds
by
prayrs
are
won
oblige
the
father
and
protect
the
son
yours
is
the
powr
nor
proserpine
in
vain
has
made
you
priestess
of
her
nightly
reign
if
orpheus
armd
with
his
enchanting
lyre
the
ruthless
king
with
pity
could
inspire
and
from
the
shades
below
redeem
his
wife
if
pollux
offring
his
alternate
life
could
free
his
brother
and
can
daily
go
by
turns
aloft
by
turns
descend
below
why
name
i
theseus
or
his
greater
friend
who
trod
the
downward
path
and
upward
could
ascend
not
less
than
theirs
from
jove
my
lineage
came
my
mother
greater
my
descent
the

so
prayd
the
trojan
prince
and
while
he
prayd
his
hand
upon
the

laid

thus
replied
the
prophetess
divine
o

born
of
great
anchises
line
the
gates
of
hell
are
open
night
and
day
smooth
the
descent
and
easy
is
the
way
but
to
return
and
view
the
cheerful
skies
in
this
the
task
and
mighty
labor
lies
to
few
great
jupiter
imparts
this
grace
and
those
of
shining
worth
and
heavnly
race
betwixt
those
regions
and
our
upper
light
deep
forests
and
impenetrable
night
possess
the
middle
space
th
infernal
bounds
cocytus
with
his
sable
waves
surrounds
but
if
so
dire
a
love
your
soul
invades
as
twice
below
to
view
the
trembling
shades
if
you
so
hard
a
toil
will
undertake
as
twice
to
pass
th
innavigable
lake
receive
my
counsel
in
the
neighbring
grove
there
stands
a
tree
the
queen
of
stygian
jove
claims
it
her
own
thick
woods
and
gloomy
night
conceal
the
happy
plant
from
human
sight
one
bough
it
bears
but
wondrous
to
behold
the
ductile
rind
and
leaves
of
radiant
gold
this
from
the
vulgar
branches
must
be
torn
and
to
fair
proserpine
the
present
borne
ere
leave
be
givn
to
tempt
the
nether
skies
the
first
thus
rent
a
second
will
arise
and
the
same
metal
the
same
room
supplies
look
round
the
wood
with
lifted
eyes
to
see
the
lurking
gold
upon
the
fatal
tree
then
rend
it
off
as
holy
rites
command
the
willing
metal
will
obey
thy
hand
following
with
ease
if
favord
by
thy
fate
thou
art
foredoomd
to
view
the
stygian
state
if
not
no
labor
can
the
tree
constrain
and
strength
of
stubborn
arms
and
steel
are
vain
besides
you
know
not
while
you
here
attend
th
unworthy
fate
of
your
unhappy
friend
breathless
he
lies
and
his
unburied
ghost
deprivd
of
funral
rites
pollutes
your
host
pay
first
his
pious
dues
and
for
the
dead
two
sable
sheep
around
his
hearse
be
led
then
living
turfs
upon
his
body
lay
this
done
securely
take
the
destind
way
to
find
the
regions
destitute
of
day
she
said
and
held
her
peace
aeneas
went
sad
from
the
cave
and
full
of
discontent
unknowing
whom
the
sacred
sibyl
meant
achates
the
companion
of
his
breast
goes
grieving
by
his
side
with
equal
cares
oppressd
walking
they
talkd
and
fruitlessly
divind
what
friend
the
priestess
by
those
words
designd
but
soon
they
found
an
object
to
deplore
misenus
lay
extended
on
the
shore
son
of
the
god
of
winds
none
so
renownd
the
warrior
trumpet
in
the
field
to
sound
with
breathing
brass
to
kindle
fierce
alarms
and
rouse
to
dare
their
fate
in
honorable
arms
he
servd
great
hector
and
was
ever
near
not
with
his
trumpet
only
but
his
spear
but
by
pelides
arms
when
hector
fell
he
chose
aeneas
and
he
chose
as
well
swoln
with
applause
and
aiming
still
at
more
he
now
provokes
the
sea
gods
from
the
shore
with
envy
triton
heard
the
martial
sound
and
the
bold
champion
for
his
challenge
drownd
then
cast
his
mangled
carcass
on
the
strand
the
gazing
crowd
around
the
body
stand
all
weep
but
most
aeneas
mourns
his
fate
and
hastens
to
perform
the
funeral
state
in
altar
wise
a
stately
pile
they
rear
the
basis
broad
below
and

advancd
in

an
ancient

designd
the

kind
the

found
the
sounding
ax
is
plied

and
pitch
trees
and
the
towring
pride
of
forest
ashes
feel
the
fatal
stroke
and
piercing
wedges
cleave
the
stubborn
oak
huge
trunks
of
trees
felld
from
the
steepy
crown
of
the
bare
mountains
roll
with
ruin
down
armd
like
the
rest
the
trojan
prince
appears
and
by
his
pious
labor
urges
theirs
thus
while
he
wrought
revolving
in
his
mind
the
ways
to
compass
what
his
wish
designd
he
cast
his
eyes
upon
the
gloomy
grove
and
then
with
vows
implord
the
queen
of
love
o
may
thy
powr
propitious
still
to
me
conduct
my
steps
to
find
the
fatal
tree
in
this
deep
forest
since
the
sibyls
breath
foretold
alas
too
true
misenus
death
scarce
had
he
said
when
full
before
his
sight
two
doves
descending
from
their
airy
flight
secure
upon
the
grassy
plain
alight
he
knew
his
mothers
birds
and
thus
he
prayd
be
you
my
guides
with
your
auspicious
aid
and
lead
my
footsteps
till
the
branch
be
found
whose
glittring
shadow
gilds
the
sacred
ground
and
thou
great
parent
with
celestial
care
in
this
distress
be
present
to
my
prayr

thus
having
said
he
stoppd
with
watchful
sight
observing
still
the
motions
of
their
flight
what
course
they
took
what
happy
signs
they
shew
they
fed
and
fluttring
by
degrees
withdrew
still
farther
from
the
place
but
still
in
view
hopping
and
flying
thus
they
led
him
on
to
the
slow
lake
whose
baleful
stench
to
shun
they
wingd
their
flight
aloft
then
stooping
low
perchd
on
the
double
tree
that
bears
the
golden
bough
thro
the
green
leafs
the
glittring
shadows
glow
as
on
the
sacred
oak
the
wintry
mistletoe
where
the
proud
mother
views
her
precious
brood
and
happier
branches
which
she
never
sowd
such
was
the
glittring
such
the
ruddy
rind
and
dancing
leaves
that
wantond
in
the
wind
he
seizd
the
shining
bough
with
griping
hold
and
rent
away
with
ease
the
lingring
gold
then
to
the
sibyls
palace
bore
the
prize
meantime
the
trojan
troops
with
weeping
eyes
to
dead
misenus
pay
his
obsequies
first
from
the
ground
a
lofty
pile
they
rear
of
pitch
trees
oaks
and
pines
and
unctuous
fir
the
fabrics

with
cypress
twigs
they
strew
and
stick
the
sides
with
boughs
of
baleful
yew
the
topmost
part
his
glittring
arms
adorn
warm
waters
then
in
brazen
caldrons
borne
are
pourd
to
wash
his
body
joint
by
joint
and
fragrant
oils
the
stiffend
limbs
anoint
with
groans
and
cries
misenus
they
deplore
then
on
a
bier
with
purple
coverd
oer
the
breathless
body
thus
bewaild
they
lay
and
fire
the
pile
their
faces
turnd
away
such
reverend

on
the
fire
they
throw
and

which
his

bestow
these
gifts
the
greedy
flames
to

devour
then
on
the
living
coals
red
wine
they
pour
and
last
the
relics
by
themselves
dispose
which
in
a
brazen
urn
the
priests
inclose
old
corynaeus
compassd
thrice
the
crew
and
dippd
an
olive
branch
in
holy
dew
which
thrice
he
sprinkled
round
and
thrice
aloud
invokd
the
dead
and
then
dismissd
the
crowd
but
good
aeneas
orderd
on
the
shore
a
stately
tomb
whose
top
a
trumpet
bore
a
soldiers
fauchion

thus
was
his

and
deathless

still
to

consigns
his

performd
the

without

astonishd
at

askd
his

from
whence
those

with

peace

came

hence
the

a

succeeded
this
with

th

long

thus
walking

since
calld

then
shews
the

in

fierce
romulus
for

a

made
with

the

where

then
tells

his

to

he

a

some

did
there
amidst

th

thought
him

said
they
saw
the

with
majestic
awe
who
took
his

dealt
his

around

scatterd

on

then

they

then
underneath

attend
their

unwilling
yet
they
keep
the
strict
command
and
sourly
wait
in

the
hostile
band
the
fiery
turnus
flew
before
the
rest
a
piebald
steed
of
thracian
strain
he
pressd
his
helm
of
massy
gold
and
crimson
was
his

with
twenty
horse
to
second
his

an
unexpected
foe
he
facd

there
he
said
in

who
bravely

his

amazd
to
find
a
dastard
race
that
run
behind
the
rampires
and
the
battle
shun
he
rides
around
the
camp
with
rolling
eyes
and
stops
at
evry
post
and
evry
passage
tries
so
roams
the
nightly
wolf
about
the
fold
wet
with
descending
showrs
and
stiff
with
cold
he
howls
for
hunger
and
he
grins
for
pain
his
gnashing
teeth
are
exercisd
in
vain
and
impotent
of
anger
finds
no

in
his
distended
paws
to
grasp
the

the

listen

the
bleating
lambs
securely
swig
the
dug
beneath
the
dams
thus
ranges
eager
turnus
oer
the
plain
sharp
with
desire
and
furious
with
disdain
surveys
each
passage
with
a
piercing
sight
to
force
his
foes
in
equal
field
to
fight
thus
while
he
gazes
round
at
length
he
spies
where
fencd
with
strong
redoubts
their
navy
lies
close
underneath
the
walls
the
washing
tide
secures
from
all
approach
this
weaker
side
he
takes
the
wishd
occasion
fills
his
hand
with
ready
fires
and
shakes
a
flaming
brand
urgd
by
his
presence
evry

is

the

what

avert
the

which
threatend

the

name
tell
for
the
fact
thro

of

obscure
is
hard
to

yet
shall
the

t
is
said
that
when
the
chief
prepard
his
flight
and
felld
his

from

idas
height
the
grandam
goddess
then
approachd
her

with

grant
me
she
said
the
sole

since
conquerd
heavn
has
ownd
you
for
its
king
on

brows
for
ages
past
there
stood
with
firs
and
maples
filld
a
shady
wood
and
on
the
summit
rose
a
sacred
grove
where
i
was
worshipd
with
religious
love
those
woods
that
holy
grove
my
long
delight
i
gave
the
trojan
prince
to

his
flight
now
filld
with
fear
on

behalf
i
come
let
neither
winds
oerset
nor

intomb
the
floating
forests
of
the
sacred
pine
but
let
it
be
their
safety
to
be
mine
then
thus
replied
her
awful
son
who
rolls
the
radiant
stars
and
heavn
and
earth
controls
how
dare
you
mother
endless
date
demand
for

molded
by
a
mortal
hand
what
then
is
fate
shall
bold
aeneas
ride
of
safety
certain
on
th
uncertain

yet
what
i
can
i
grant
when
wafted
oer
the
chief
is
landed
on
the
latian
shore
whatever
ships
escape
the
raging
storms
at
my
command
shall
change
their
fading
forms
to
nymphs
divine
and
plow
the
watry
way
like
dotis
and
the
daughters
of
the
sea
to
seal
his
sacred
vow
by
styx
he
swore
the

of
liquid
pitch
the
dreary
shore
and
phlegethons
innavigable
flood
and
the
black
regions
of
his

god
he
said
and
shook
the
skies
with
his
imperial
nod
and
now
at
length
the
numberd
hours
were
come
prefixd
by
fates
irrevocable
doom
when
the
great
mother
of
the
gods
was
free
to
save
her

and
finish
joves
decree
first
from
the

of

there
sprung
a

shot
along
then
from

fringd
round
with
golden

were
timbrels

and

a

his

their

stood
horrid
with

intricate
with

misled
the

nisus
hit

forelaid

in

oppressd
in

resolvd

spear
he
shook

casting
on

a

guardian

struck
with
deep
despair
that
cruel
sight
the

from

his

crime

justly

borne

he

still

then
whirld
aloft

quiet

all

wakning
with

calls
his

casting
from

they
saw
the

they
knew

disguisd
in

smeard
all
oer
with
filth
obscene

soon

benumbs

she
shakes

the

forsakes
she
runs
the

she
rends
her

fills
with
loud
laments
the

thus
then
my

thus
looks
the

of
my
declining
years
wast
on

ah
how
unlike
the

is
the
dead
and
couldst
thou
leave
me
cruel
thus
alone
not
one

kiss
from
a
departing
son
no
look
no
last
adieu
before
he
went
in
an
ill
boding
hour
to
slaughter
sent
cold
on
the

and
pressing
foreign
clay
to
latian
dogs
and

he
lies
a

nor
was
i

to
close
his
dying

to
wash
his

to
weep
his
obsequies
to
call
about
his

ends
on
his

body
which
i
wove
with
care
nor
did
my
daily
pains
or
nightly
labor
spare
where
shall
i
find
his
corpse
what
earth
sustains
his

dismemberd
and
his

for

alas
i
left

thunderstruck

augment
their

by

more
than

inspird
he

with

unfinishd

forsakes

takes
when
have
i

did
i

give
this
mad
advice
or
made
the
fool
himself
the
fatal
choice
you
think
it
hard
the
latians
should
destroy
with
swords
your
trojans
and
with

your
troy
hard
and
unjust
indeed
for

to
draw
their

take
a
foreign
law
that
turnus
is
permitted
still
to
live
to
whom
his

give
but
yet
t
is
just
and
lawful
for
your
line
to
drive
their
fields
and
force
with
fraud
to
join
realms
not
your

among
your

divide

from
the
bridegroom
tear
the

you
public
arms

t

t

absent

these

next

and
takes

on

many
shields
with

like
his
the

stood
and
soon
the

with
falling
corps
were
strowd
when
once
his

found
the
taste
of

with
fury
scarce
to

he
flew
against
niphaeus

four

drew

advance

pushing
at

his

lance
wheeld
with
so
swift
a

mad
with

headlong

before
they
bear
the
bounding
chariot

aeneas
couchd
his

unusd

thus
thy

is

thus
liger
vainly
vaunts
the
trojan
peer
returnd
his
answer
with
his

as
lucagus
to
lash
his

bends
prone

drives
passd

vain
shadows
did
not
force

he
said
and

at

for

lay
already
on

by
the

shock
then
stretching

by

o
more
than
mortal
man
by
her
and
him
from
whom
thy
breath
began
who
formd
thee
thus
divine
i
beg
thee
spare
this
forfeit
life
and
hear
thy

prayr
thus
much
he
spoke
and
more
he
would
have
said
but
the
stern
hero
turnd
aside
his

and
cut
him
short
i

you
talkd
not
thus
before
the
fight
began
now
take
your
turn
and
as
a
brother
should
attend
your
brother
to
the
stygian
flood
then
thro
his
breast
his
fatal
sword
he
sent
and
the
soul
issued
at
the
gaping
vent
as
storms
the
skies
and
torrents
tear
the
ground
thus
ragd
the
prince
and
scatterd
deaths
around
at
length
ascanius
and
the
trojan
train
broke
from
the
camp
so
long
besiegd
in
vain
meantime
the
king
of
gods
and
mortal
man
held
conference
with
his
queen
and
thus
began
my
sister
goddess
and
well
pleasing
wife
still
think
you
venus
aid
supports
the
strife
sustains
her
trojans
or
themselves
alone
with
inborn
valor
force
their
fortune
on
how
fierce
in
fight
with
courage
undecayd
judge
if
such
warriors
want
immortal
aid
to
whom
the
goddess
with
the
charming
eyes
soft
in
her
tone
submissively
replies
why
o
my
sovreign
lord
whose
frown
i
fear
and
cannot
unconcernd
your
anger
bear
why
urge
you
thus
my
grief
when
if
i
still
as
once
i
was
were
mistress
of
your
will
from
your
almighty
powr
your
pleasing
wife
might
gain
the
grace
of
lengthning
turnus
life
securely
snatch
him
from
the
fatal
fight
and
give
him
to
his
aged
fathers
sight
now
let
him
perish
since
you
hold
it
good
and
glut
the
trojans
with
his
pious
blood
yet
from
our
lineage
he
derives
his
name
and
in
the
fourth
degree
from
god
pilumnus
came
yet
he
devoutly
pays
you
rites
divine
and
offers
daily
incense
at
your
shrine
then
shortly
thus
the
sovreign
god
replied
since
in
my
powr
and
goodness
you
confide
if
for
a
little
space
a
lengthend
span
you
beg
reprieve
for
this
expiring
man
i
grant
you
leave
to
take
your
turnus
hence
from
instant
fate
and
can
so
far
dispense
but
if
some
secret
meaning
lies
beneath
to
save
the
short
livd
youth
from
destind
death
or
if
a
farther
thought
you
entertain
to
change
the
fates
you
feed
your
hopes
in
vain
to
whom
the
goddess
thus
with
weeping
eyes
and
what
if
that
request
your
tongue
denies
your
heart
should
grant
and
not
a
short
reprieve
but
length
of
certain
life
to
turnus
give
now
speedy
death
attends
the
guiltless
youth
if
my
presaging
soul
divines
with
truth
which
o
i
wish
might
err
thro
causeless
fears
and
you
for
you
have
powr
prolong
his
years
thus
having
said
involvd
in
clouds
she
flies
and
drives
a
storm
before
her
thro
the
skies
swift
she
descends
alighting
on
the
plain
where
the
fierce
foes
a
dubious
fight
maintain
of
air
condensd
a
specter
soon
she
made
and
what
aeneas
was
such
seemd
the
shade
adornd
with
dardan
arms
the
phantom
bore
his
head
aloft
a
plumy
crest
he
wore
this
hand
appeard
a
shining
sword
to
wield
and
that
sustaind
an
imitated
shield
with
manly
mien
he
stalkd
along
the
ground
nor
wanted
voice
belied
nor
vaunting
sound
thus
haunting
ghosts
appear
to
waking
sight
or
dreadful
visions
in
our
dreams
by
night
the
specter
seems
the
daunian
chief
to
dare
and
flourishes
his
empty
sword
in
air
at
this
advancing
turnus
hurld
his
spear
the
phantom
wheeld
and
seemd
to
fly
for
fear
deluded
turnus
thought
the
trojan
fled
and
with
vain
hopes
his
haughty
fancy
fed
whether
o
coward
thus
he
calls
aloud
nor
found
he
spoke
to
wind
and
chasd
a
cloud
why
thus
forsake
your
bride
receive
from
me
the
fated
land
you
sought
so
long
by

he
said
and
brandishing
at

his
blade
with
eager
pace
pursued
the
flying
shade
by
chance
a

went
exulting

with

haste
ascends
the

to

there
he
lies
with
silent
grief
that
speaks
but
at
his
eyes
short
sighs
and
sobs
succeed
till
sorrow
breaks
a
passage
and
at

he
weeps
and

o

thou

faild
thy
plighted
word
to
fight
with
caution
not
to
tempt
the
sword
i
warnd
thee

in

for

i
knew
what

youthful
ardor
would
pursue
that
boiling

would
carry
thee
too

young
as
thou
wert

thrice
happy
thou

the

behind
to

the

by

assignd

i

my

upbraid

grudge
th

i
so
gladly
made
t
was
not
his
fault
my
pallas
fell
so
young
but
my

crime
for
having
livd
too
long
yet
since
the

had
destind
him
to
die
at

he
led
the
way
to

first
for
his

he
won
the

shore
and
sent
whole

foes
before

too
great
too
glorious
to
deplore
nor

i
add
new
honors
to

the

gave

the

thou

about

thrice
with
loud
laments
they
hail
the

tears
trickling
down
their

bedew
the

and
drums
and
trumpets

a

in

a

a

these

the

with

load
the

exclaim

our

to

t
is
just
the
sway
he
seeks
he
should
deserve
this
drances
aggravates
and
adds
with
spite
his
foe
expects
and
dares
him
to
the

nor
turnus
wants
a
party
to
support
his

they
bring
that
after

yet
unknowing
how
to

what

you

our

what
his

the

who
menaces

yet
after

forsook
the

sought

in
ignoble
flight
now
best

since
you

send
such
bounteous

to
your

the

the

replied
brave

the

your

been
tried
the
more
becomes
it
us
with

respect
to
weigh
the
chance
of
war
which
you
neglect
you
want
not
wealth
or
a

throne
or
cities
which
your

have
made
your

my

are
at

more
than

fair
of

now
let
me
speak
and
you
with
patience
hear
things
which
perhaps
may
grate
a
lovers
ear
but
sound
advice
proceeding
from
a
heart
sincerely
yours

free
from
fraudful
art
the
gods
by

have
manifestly
shown
no

t

needless

you
have
had
your

twice
vanquishd
while

keep
our

alive
the
rolling
flood
runs
warm
with

the

why
put
i
not
an

to
this
debate
still
unresolvd
and
still
a
slave
to
fate
if
turnus
death
a
lasting
peace
can
give
why
should
i
not
procure
it
whilst
you
live
should
i
to
doubtful

your

betray
what
would
my

the

say

should
you
fall

the
wrathful

disdaining

with

thus

which
you
take

me
not

for

this

he

courage
conspires
with

young

aims

full
on

of

shrill

he
flies
when

disorderd
in

snatchd
the

weapon
which
his

not
the

his

bore

that
his
charioteer
metiscus
wore
this
while
the

fled
the

against
the

vulcanian

the

steel
deceivd
his

the

shone
amid

surprisd

he
fled
along

forthright

wheeld
for
here
the

troops
the

surround

there
the

is
closd
with
pools

aeneas
hastens
tho
with
heavier

his
wound
so
newly
knit
retards
the
chase
and
oft
his
trembling
knees
their

refuse
yet
pressing
foot
by
foot
his
foe
pursues
thus
when
a
fearful
stag
is
closd
around
with
crimson
toils
or
in
a
river
found
high
on
the

the
deep

appears
still
opening

steers
the

to

here
and
there
to

his
umbrian
foe
steep

th
ascent
and
if
he
gains
the

the

death
is
pitchd
along
the

his

foe
determind
to
the

stretchd
at

gains
ground
at
evry
pace
now
to
his
beamy
head
he
makes
his

and
now
he
holds
or
thinks
he
holds
his
prey
just
at
the
pinch
the
stag
springs
out
with
fear
he
bites
the
wind
and
fills
his
sounding
jaws
with
air
the
rocks
the
lakes
the
meadows
ring
with
cries
the
mortal
tumult
mounts
and
thunders
in
the

thus
flies
the
daunian
prince
and
flying
blames
his
tardy
troops
and
calling
by
their

demands
his
trusty

the
trojan
threats
the

in

mind

thy
swiftness
can
secure
thy
flight
not
with
their
feet
but
hands
the
valiant
fight
vary
thy
shape
in
thousand
forms
and
dare
what
skill
and
courage
can
attempt
in
war
wish
for
the
wings
of
winds
to
mount

or

within
the

earth

the
champion
shook
his
head
and
made
this
short
reply
no
threats
of
thine
my
manly
mind
can
move
t
is
hostile
heavn
i
dread
and
partial
jove
he
said
no
more
but
with
a
sigh
repressd
the
mighty
sorrow
in
his
swelling
breast
then
as
he
rolld
his
troubled
eyes
around
an
antique
stone
he
saw
the
common
bound
of
neighbring
fields
and
barrier
of
the
ground
so
vast
that
twelve
strong
men
of
modern
days
th
enormous
weight
from
earth
could
hardly
raise
he
heavd
it
at
a
lift
and
poisd
on
high
ran
staggring
on
against
his
enemy
but
so
disorderd
that
he
scarcely
knew
his
way
or
what
unwieldly
weight
he
threw
his
knocking
knees
are
bent
beneath
the
load
and
shivring
cold
congeals
his
vital
blood
the
stone
drops
from
his
arms
and
falling
short
for
want
of
vigor
mocks
his
vain
effort
and
as
when
heavy
sleep
has
closd
the
sight
the
sickly
fancy
labors
in
the
night
we
seem
to
run
and
destitute
of
force
our
sinking
limbs
forsake
us
in
the
course
in
vain
we
heave
for
breath
in
vain
we
cry
the
nerves
unbracd
their
usual
strength
deny
and
on
the
tongue
the
faltring
accents
die
so
turnus
fard
whatever
means
he
tried
all
force
of
arms
and
points
of
art
employd
the
fury
flew
athwart
and
made
th
endeavor
void
a
thousand
various
thoughts
his
soul
confound
he
stard
about
nor
aid
nor
issue
found
his
own
men
stop
the
pass
and
his
own
walls
surround
once
more
he
pauses
and
looks
out
again
and
seeks
the
goddess
charioteer
in
vain
trembling
he
views
the
thundring
chief
advance
and
brandishing
aloft
the
deadly
lance
amazd
he
cowrs
beneath
his
conquring
foe
forgets
to
ward
and
waits
the
coming
blow
astonishd
while
he
stands
and
fixd
with
fear
aimd
at
his
shield
he
sees
th
impending
spear
the
hero
measurd
first
with
narrow
view
the
destind
mark
and
rising
as
he
threw
with
its
full
swing
the
fatal
weapon
flew
not
with
less
rage
the
rattling
thunder
falls
or
stones
from
battring
engines
break
the
walls
swift
as
a
whirlwind
from
an
arm
so
strong
the
lance
drove
on
and
bore
the
death
along
naught
could
his
sevnfold
shield
the
prince
avail
nor
aught
beneath
his
arms
the
coat
of
mail
it
piercd
thro
all
and
with
a
grisly
wound
transfixd
his
thigh
and
doubled
him
to
ground
with
groans
the
latins
rend
the
vaulted
sky
woods
hills
and
valleys
to
the
voice
reply
now
low
on
earth
the
lofty
chief
is
laid
with
eyes
cast
upward
and
with
arms
displayd
and
recreant
thus
to
the
proud
victor
prayd
i
know
my
death
deservd
nor
hope
to
live
use
what
the
gods
and
thy
good
fortune
give
yet
think
o
think
if
mercy
may
be
shown
thou
hadst
a
father
once
and
hast
a
son
pity
my
sire
now
sinking
to
the
grave
and
for
anchises
sake
old
daunus
save
or
if
thy
vowd
revenge
pursue
my
death
give
to
my
friends
my
body
void
of
breath
the
latian
chiefs
have
seen
me
beg
my
life
thine
is
the
conquest
thine
the
royal
wife
against
a
yielded
man
t
is
mean
ignoble
strife
in
deep
suspense
the
trojan
seemd
to
stand
and
just
prepard
to
strike
repressd
his
hand
he
rolld
his
eyes
and
evry
moment
felt
his
manly
soul
with
more
compassion
melt
when
casting
down
a
casual
glance
he
spied
the
golden
belt
that
glitterd
on
his
side
the
fatal
spoils
which
haughty
turnus
tore
from
dying
pallas
and
in
triumph
wore
then
rousd
anew
to
wrath
he
loudly
cries
flames
while
he
spoke
came
flashing
from
his
eyes
traitor
dost
thou
dost
thou
to
grace
pretend
clad
as
thou
art
in
trophies
of
my
friend
to
his
sad
soul
a
grateful
offring
go
t
is
pallas
pallas
gives
this
deadly
blow
he
raisd
his
arm
aloft
and
at
the
word
deep
in
his
bosom
drove
the
shining
sword
the
streaming
blood
distaind
his
arms
around
and
the
disdainful
soul
came
rushing
thro
the
wound
end
