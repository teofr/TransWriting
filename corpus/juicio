the
faculty
of
knowledge
from
a
priori
principles
may
be
called
pure
reason
and
the
general
investigation
into
its
possibility
and
bounds
the
critique
of
pure
reason
this
is
permissible
although
pure
reason
as
was
the
case
with
the
same
use
of
terms
in
our
first
work
is
only
intended
to
denote
reason
in
its
theoretical
employment
and
although
there
is
no
desire
to
bring
under
review
its
faculty
as
practical
reason
and
its
special
principles
as
such
that
critique
is
then
an
investigation
addressed
simply
to
our
faculty
of
knowing
things
a
priori
hence
it
makes
our
cognitive
faculties
its
sole
concern
to
the
exclusion
of
the
feeling
of
pleasure
or
displeasure
and
the
faculty
of
desire
and
among
the
cognitive
faculties
it
confines
its
attention
to
understanding
and
its
a
priori
principles
to
the
exclusion
of
judgement
and
reason
faculties
that
also
belong
to
theoretical
cognition
because
it
turns
out
in
the
sequel
that
there
is
no
cognitive
faculty
other
than
understanding
capable
of
affording
constitutive
a
priori
principles
of
knowledge
accordingly
the
critique
which
sifts
these
faculties
one
and
all
so
as
to
try
the
possible
claims
of
each
of
the
other
faculties
to
a
share
in
the
clear
possession
of
knowledge
from
roots
of
its
own
retains
nothing
but
what
understanding
prescribes
a
priori
as
a
law
for
nature
as
the
complex
of
phenomena
the
form
of
these
being
similarly
furnished
a
priori
all
other
pure
concepts
it
relegates
to
the
rank
of
ideas
which
for
our
faculty
of
theoretical
cognition
are
transcendent
though
they
are
not
without
their
use
nor
redundant
but
discharge
certain
functions
as
regulative
principles
for
these
concepts
serve
partly
to
restrain
the
officious
pretentions
of
understanding
which
presuming
on
its
ability
to
supply
a
priori
the
conditions
of
the
possibility
of
all
things
which
it
is
capable
of
knowing
behaves
as
if
it
had
thus
determined
these
bounds
as
those
of
the
possibility
of
all
things
generally
and
partly
also
to
lead
understanding
in
its
study
of
nature
according
to
a
principle
of
completeness
unattainable
as
this
remains
for
it
and
so
to
promote
the
ultimate
aim
of
all
knowledge

word
is

properly
therefore
it
was
understanding
which
so
far
as
it
contains
constitutive
a
priori
cognitive
principles
has
its
special
realm
and
one
moreover
in
our
faculty
of
knowledge
that
the
critique
called
in
a
general
way
that
of
pure
reason
was
intended
to
establish
in
secure
but
particular
possession
against
all
other
competitors
in
the
same
way
reason
which
contains
constitutive
a
priori
principles
solely
in
respect
of
the
faculty
of
desire
gets
its
holding
assigned
to
it
by
the
critique
of
practical
reason
but
now
comes
judgement
which
in
the
order
of
our
cognitive
faculties
forms
a
middle
term
between
understanding
and
reason
has
it
also
got
independent
a
priori
principles
if
so
are
they
constitutive
or
are
they
merely
regulative
thus
indicating
no
special
realm
and
do
they
give
a
rule
a
priori
to
the
feeling
of
pleasure
and
displeasure
as
the
middle
term
between
the
faculties
of
cognition
and
desire
just
as
understanding
prescribes
laws
a
priori
for
the
former
and
reason
for
the
latter
this
is
the
topic
to
which
the
present
critique
is
devoted
a
critique
of
pure
reason
i
e
of
our
faculty
of
judging
on
a
priori
principles
would
be
incomplete
if
the
critical
examination
of
judgement
which
is
a
faculty
of
knowledge
and
as
such
lays
claim
to
independent
principles
were
not
dealt
with
separately
still
however
its
principles
cannot
in
a
system
of
pure
philosophy
form
a
separate
constituent
part
intermediate
between
the
theoretical
and
practical
divisions
but
may
when
needful
be
annexed
to
one
or
other
as
occasion
requires
for
if
such
a
system
is
some
day
worked
out
under
the
general
name
of
metaphysic
and
its
full
and
complete
execution
is
both
possible
and
of
the
utmost
importance
for
the
employment
of
reason
in
all
departments
of
its
activity
the
critical
examination
of
the
ground
for
this
edifice
must
have
been
previously
carried
down
to
the
very
depths
of
the
foundations
of
the
faculty
of
principles
independent
of
experience
lest
in
some
quarter
it
might
give
way
and
sinking
inevitably
bring
with
it
the
ruin
of
all
we
may
readily
gather
however
from
the
nature
of
the
faculty
of
judgement
whose
correct
employment
is
so
necessary
and
universally
requisite
that
it
is
just
this
faculty
that
is
intended
when
we
speak
of
sound
understanding
that
the
discovery
of
a
peculiar
principle
belonging
to
it
and
some
such
it
must
contain
in
itself
a
priori
for
otherwise
it
would
not
be
a
cognitive
faculty
the
distinctive
character
of
which
is
obvious
to
the
most
commonplace
criticism
must
be
a
task
involving
considerable
difficulties
for
this
principle
is
one
which
must
not
be
derived
from
a
priori
concepts
seeing
that
these
are
the
property
of
understanding
and
judgement
is
only
directed
to
their
application
it
has
therefore
itself
to
furnish
a
concept
and
one
from
which
properly
we
get
no
cognition
of
a
thing
but
which
it
can
itself
employ
as
a
rule
only
but
not
as
an
objective
rule
to
which
it
can
adapt
its
judgement
because
for
that
another
faculty
of
judgement
would
again
be
required
to
enable
us
to
decide
whether
the
case
was
one
for
the
application
of
the
rule
or
not
it
is
chiefly
in
those
estimates
that
are
called
aesthetic
and
which
relate
to
the
beautiful
and
sublime
whether
of
nature
or
of
art
that
one
meets
with
the
above
difficulty
about
a
principle
be
it
subjective
or
objective
and
yet
the
critical
search
for
a
principle
of
judgement
in
their
case
is
the
most
important
item
in
a
critique
of
this
faculty
for
although
they
do
not
of
themselves
contribute
a
whit
to
the
knowledge
of
things
they
still
belong
wholly
to
the
faculty
of
knowledge
and
evidence
an
immediate
bearing
of
this
faculty
upon
the
feeling
of
pleasure
or
displeasure
according
to
some
a
priori
principle
and
do
so
without
confusing
this
principle
with
what
is
capable
of
being
a
determining
ground
of
the
faculty
of
desire
for
the
latter
has
its
principles
a
priori
in
concepts
of
reason
logical
estimates
of
nature
however
stand
on
a
different
footing
they
deal
with
cases
in
which
experience
presents
a
conformity
to
law
in
things
which
the
understandings
general
concept
of
the
sensible
is
no
longer
adequate
to
render
intelligible
or
explicable
and
in
which
judgement
may
have
recourse
to
itself
for
a
principle
of
the
reference
of
the
natural
thing
to
the
unknowable
supersensible
and
indeed
must
employ
some
such
principle
though
with
a
regard
only
to
itself
and
the
knowledge
of
nature
for
in
these
cases
the
application
of
such
an
a
priori
principle
for
the
cognition
of
what
is
in
the
world
is
both
possible
and
necessary
and
withal
opens
out
prospects
which
are
profitable
for
practical
reason
but
here
there
is
no
immediate
reference
to
the
feeling
of
pleasure
or
displeasure
but
this
is
precisely
the
riddle
in
the
principle
of
judgement
that
necessitates
a
separate
division
for
this
faculty
in
the
critique
for
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
the
formation
of
logical
estimates
according
to
concepts
from
which
no
immediate
conclusion
can
ever
be
drawn
to
the
feeling
of
pleasure
or
displeasure
having
been
treated
with
a
critical
statement
of
its
limitations
in
an
appendage
to
the
theoretical
part
of
philosophy

the
present
investigation
of
taste
as
a
faculty
of
aesthetic
judgement
not
being
undertaken
with
a
view
to
the
formation
or
culture
of
taste
which
will
pursue
its
course
in
the
future
as
in
the
past
independently
of
such
inquiries
but
being
merely
directed
to
its
transcendental
aspects
i
feel
assured
of
its
indulgent
criticism
in
respect
of
any
shortcomings
on
that
score
but
in
all
that
is
relevant
to
the
transcendental
aspect
it
must
be
prepared
to
stand
the
test
of
the
most
rigorous
examination
yet
even
here
i
venture
to
hope
that
the
difficulty
of
unravelling
a
problem
so
involved
in
its
nature
may
serve
as
an
excuse
for
a
certain
amount
of
hardly
avoidable
obscurity
in
its
solution
provided
that
the
accuracy
of
our
statement
of
the
principle
is
proved
with
all
requisite
clearness
i
admit
that
the
mode
of
deriving
the
phenomena
of
judgement
from
that
principle
has
not
all
the
lucidity
that
is
rightly
demanded
elsewhere
where
the
subject
is
cognition
by
concepts
and
that
i
believe
i
have
in
fact
attained
in
the
second
part
of
this
work
with
this
then
i
bring
my
entire
critical
undertaking
to
a
close
i
shall
hasten
to
the
doctrinal
part
in
order
as
far
as
possible
to
snatch
from
my
advancing
years
what
time
may
yet
be
favourable
to
the
task
it
is
obvious
that
no
separate
division
of
doctrine
is
reserved
for
the
faculty
of
judgement
seeing
that
with
judgement
critique
takes
the
place
of
theory
but
following
the
division
of
philosophy
into
theoretical
and
practical
and
of
pure
philosophy
in
the
same
way
the
whole
ground
will
be
covered
by
the
metaphysics
of
nature
and
of
morals
intro
introduction
i
division
of
philosophy
philosophy
may
be
said
to
contain
the
principles
of
the
rational
cognition
that
concepts
afford
us
of
things
not
merely
as
with
logic
the
principles
of
the
form
of
thought
in
general
irrespective
of
the
objects
and
thus
interpreted
the
course
usually
adopted
of
dividing
it
into
theoretical
and
practical
is
perfectly
sound
but
this
makes
imperative
a
specific
distinction
on
the
part
of
the
concepts
by
which
the
principles
of
this
rational
cognition
get
their
object
assigned
to
them
for
if
the
concepts
are
not
distinct
they
fail
to
justify
a
division
which
always
presupposes
that
the
principles
belonging
to
the
rational
cognition
of
the
several
parts
of
the
science
in
question
are
themselves
mutually
exclusive
now
there
are
but
two
kinds
of
concepts
and
these
yield
a
corresponding
number
of
distinct
principles
of
the
possibility
of
their
objects
the
concepts
referred
to
are
those
of
nature
and
that
of
freedom
by
the
first
of
these
a
theoretical
cognition
from
a
priori
principles
becomes
possible
in
respect
of
such
cognition
however
the
second
by
its
very
concept
imports
no
more
than
a
negative
principle
that
of
simple
antithesis
while
for
the
determination
of
the
will
on
the
other
hand
it
establishes
fundamental
principles
which
enlarge
the
scope
of
its
activity
and
which
on
that
account
are
called
practical
hence
the
division
of
philosophy
falls
properly
into
two
parts
quite
distinct
in
their
principles
a
theoretical
as
philosophy
of
nature
and
a
practical
as
philosophy
of
morals
for
this
is
what
the
practical
legislation
of
reason
by
the
concept
of
freedom
is
called
hitherto
however
in
the
application
of
these
expressions
to
the
division
of
the
different
principles
and
with
them
to
the
division
of
philosophy
a
gross
misuse
of
the
terms
has
prevailed
for
what
is
practical
according
to
concepts
of
nature
bas
been
taken
as
identical
with
what
is
practical
according
to
the
concept
of
freedom
with
the
result
that
a
division
has
been
made
under
these
heads
of
theoretical
and
practical
by
which
in
effect
there
has
been
no
division
at
all
seeing
that
both
parts
might
have
similar
principles
the
will
for
this
is
what
is
said
is
the
faculty
of
desire
and
as
such
is
just
one
of
the
many
natural
causes
in
the
world
the
one
namely
which
acts
by
concepts
and
whatever
is
represented
as
possible
or
necessary
through
the
efficacy
of
will
is
called
practically
possible
or
necessary
the
intention
being
to
distinguish
its
possibility
or
necessity
from
the
physical
possibility
or
necessity
of
an
effect
the
causality
of
whose
cause
is
not
determined
to
its
production
by
concepts
but
rather
as
with
lifeless
matter
by
mechanism
and
as
with
the
lower
animals
by
instinct
now
the
question
in
respect
of
the
practical
faculty
whether
that
is
to
say
the
concept
by
which
the
causality
of
the
will
gets
its
rule
is
a
concept
of
nature
or
of
freedom
is
here
left
quite
open
the
latter
distinction
however
is
essential
for
let
the
concept
determining
the
causality
be
a
concept
of
nature
and
then
the
principles
are
technically
practical
but
let
it
be
a
concept
of
freedom
and
they
are
morally
practical
now
in
the
division
of
a
rational
science
the
difference
between
objects
that
require
different
principles
for
their
cognition
is
the
difference
on
which
everything
turns
hence
technically
practical
principles
belong
to
theoretical
philosophy
natural
science
whereas
those
morally
practical
alone
form
the
second
part
that
is
practical

ethical
science

all
technically
practical
rules
i
e
those
of
art
and
skill
generally
or
even
of
prudence
as
a
skill
in
exercising
an
influence
over
men
and
their
wills
must
so
far
as
their
principles
rest
upon
concepts
be
reckoned
only
as
corollaries
to
theoretical
philosophy
for
they
only
touch
the
possibility
of
things
according
to
concepts
of
nature
and
this
embraces
not
alone
the
means
discoverable
in
nature
for
the
purpose
but
even
the
will
itself
as
a
faculty
of
desire
and
consequently
a
natural
faculty
so
far
as
it
is
determinable
on
these
rules
by
natural
motives
still
these
practical
rules
are
not
called
laws
like
physical
laws
but
only
precepts
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
will
does
not
stand
simply
under
the
natural
concept
but
also
under
the
concept
of
freedom
in
the
latter
connection
its
principles
are
called
laws
and
these
principles
with
the
addition
of
what
follows
them
alone
constitute
the
second
at
practical
part
of
philosophy
the
solution
of
the
problems
of
pure
geometry
is
not
allocated
to
a
special
part
of
that
science
nor
does
the
art
of
land
surveying
merit
the
name
of
practical
in
contradistinction
to
pure
as
a
second
part
of
the
general
science
of
geometry
and
with
equally
little
or
perhaps
less
right
can
the
mechanical
or
chemical
art
of
experiment
or
of
observation
be
ranked
as
a
practical
part
of
the
science
of
nature
or
in
fine
domestic
agricultural
or
political
economy
the
art
of
social
intercourse
the
principles
of
dietetics
or
even
general
instruction
as
to
the
attainment
of
happiness
or
as
much
as
the
control
of
the
inclinations
or
the
restraining
of
the
affections
with
a
view
thereto
be
denominated
practical
philosophy
not
to
mention
forming
these
latter
in
a
second
part
of
philosophy
in
general
for
between
them
all
the
above
contain
nothing
more
than
rules
of
skill
which
are
thus
only
technically
practical
the
skill
being
directed
to
producing
an
effect
which
is
possible
according
to
natural
concepts
of
causes
and
effects
as
these
concepts
belong
to
theoretical
philosophy
they
are
subject
to
those
precepts
as
mere
corollaries
of
theoretical
philosophy
i
e
as
corollaries
of
natural
science
and
so
cannot
claim
any
place
in
any
special
philosophy
called
practical
on
the
other
hand
the
morally
practical
precepts
which
are
founded
entirely
on
the
concept
of
freedom
to
the
complete
exclusion
of
grounds
taken
from
nature
for
the
determination
of
the
will
form
quite
a
special
kind
of
precepts
these
too
like
the
rules
obeyed
by
nature
are
without
qualification
called
laws
though
they
do
not
like
the
latter
rest
on
sensible
conditions
but
upon
a
supersensible
principle
and
they
must
needs
have
a
separate
part
of
philosophy
allotted
to
them
as
their
own
corresponding
to
the
theoretical
part
and
termed
practical
philosophy
capable
hence
it
is
evident
that
a
complex
of
practical
precepts
furnished
by
philosophy
does
not
form
a

of
philosophy

with
the
theoretical

that
they

that
their

were
derived
wholly
from
the

of

as
technically
practical

but
an
adequate
reason
only
exists
where
their
principle
being
in
no
way
borrowed
from
the
concept
of
nature
which
is
always
sensibly
conditioned
rests
consequently
on
the
supersensible
which
the
concept
of
freedom
alone
makes
cognizable
by

of
its
formal

therefore
they

the
employment
of
our
faculty
of
cognition
from
principles
and
with
it
philosophy
is
coextensive
with
the
applicability
of
a
priori
concepts
now
a
division
of
the
complex
of
all
the
objects
to
which
those
concepts
are
referred
for
the
purpose
where
possible
of
compassing
their
knowledge
may
be
made
according
to
the
varied
competence
or
incompetence
of
our
faculty
in
that
connection
concepts
so
far
as
they
are
referred
to
objects
apart
from
the
question
of
whether
knowledge
of
them
is
possible
or
not
have
their
field
which
is
determined
simply
by
the
relation
in
which
their
object
stands
to
our
faculty
of
cognition
in
general
the
part
of
this
field
in
which
knowledge
is
possible
for
us
is
a
territory
territorium
for
these
concepts
and
the
requisite
cognitive
faculty
the
part
of
the
territory
over
which
they
exercise
legislative
authority
is
the
realm
ditio
of
these
concepts
and
their
appropriate
cognitive
faculty
empirical
concepts
have
therefore
their
territory
doubtless
in
nature
as
the
complex
of
all
sensible
objects
but
they
have
no
realm
only
a
dwelling
place
domicilium
for
although
they
are
formed
according
to
law
they
are
not
themselves
legislative
but
the
rules
founded
on
them
are
empirical
and
consequently
contingent
our
entire
faculty
of
cognition
has
two
realms
that
of
natural
concepts
and
that
of
the
concept
of
freedom
for
through
both
it
prescribes
laws
a
priori
in
accordance
with
this
distinction
then
philosophy
is
divisible
into
theoretical
and
practical
but
the
territory
upon
which
its
realm
is
established
and
over
which
it
exercises
its
legislative
authority
is
still
always
confined
to
the
complex
of
the
objects
of
all
possible
experience
taken
as
no
more
than
mere
phenomena
for
otherwise
legislation
by
the
understanding
in
respect
of
them
is
unthinkable
intro
paragraph

the
function
of
prescribing
laws
by
means
of
concepts
of
nature
is
discharged
by
understanding
and
is
theoretical
that
of
prescribing
laws
by
means
of
the
concept
of
freedom
is
discharged
by
reason
and
is
merely
practical
it
is
only
in
the
practical
sphere
that
reason
can
prescribe
laws
in
respect
of
theoretical
knowledge
of
nature
it
can
only
as
by
the
understanding
advised
in
the
law
deduce
from
given
logical
consequences
which
still
always
remain
restricted
to
nature
but
we
cannot
reverse
this
and
say
that
where
rules
are
practical
reason
is
then
and
there
legislative
since
the
rules
might
be
technically
practical
understanding
and
reason
therefore
have
two
distinct
jurisdictions
over
one
and
the
same
territory
of
experience
but
neither
can
interfere
with
the
other
for
the
concept
of
freedom
just
as
little
disturbs
the
legislation
of
nature
as
the
concept
of
nature
influences
legislation
through
the
concept
of
freedom
that
it
is
possible
for
us
at
least
to
think
without
contradiction
of
both
these
jurisdictions
and
their
appropriate
faculties
as
co
existing
in
the
same
subject
was
shown
by
the
critique
of
pure
reason
since
it
disposed
of
the
objections
on
the
other
side
by
detecting
their
dialectical
illusion
still
how
does
it
happen
that
these
two
different
realms
do
not
form
one
realm
seeing
that
while
they
do
not
limit
each
other
in
their
legislation
they
continually
do
so
in
their
effects
in
the
sensible
world
the
explanation
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
concept
of
nature
represents
its
objects
in
intuition
doubtless
yet
not
as
things
in
themselves
but
as
mere
phenomena
whereas
the
concept
of
freedom
represents
in
its
object
what
is
no
doubt
a
thing
in
itself
but
it
does
not
make
it
intuitable
and
further
that
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
is
capable
therefore
of
furnishing
a
theoretical
cognition
of
its
object
or
even
of
the
thinking
subject
as
a
thing
in
itself
or
as
this
would
be
of
the
supersensible
idea
of
which
has
certainly
to
be
introduced
as
the
basis
of
the
possibility
of
all
those
objects
of
experience
although
it
cannot
itself
ever
be
elevated
or
extended
into
a
cognition
our
entire
cognitive
faculty
is
therefore
presented
with
an
unbounded
but
also
inaccessible
field
the
field
of
the
supersensible
in
which
we
seek
in
vain
for
a
territory
and
on
which
therefore
we
can
have
no
realm
for
theoretical
cognition
be
it
for
concepts
of
understanding
or
of
reason
this
field
we
must
indeed
occupy
with
ideas
in
the
interest
as
well
of
the
theoretical
as
the
practical
employment
of
reason
but
in
connection
with
the
laws
arising
from
the
concept
of
freedom
we
cannot
procure
for
these
ideas
any
but
practical
reality
which
accordingly
fails
to
advance
our
theoretical
cognition
one
step
towards
the
supersensible
albeit
then
between
the
realm
of
the
natural
concept
as
the
sensible
and
the
realm
of
the
concept
of
freedom
as
the
supersensible
there
is
a
great
gulf
fixed
so
that
it
is
not
possible
to
pass
from
the
to
the
latter
by
means
of
the
theoretical
employment
of
reason
just
as
if
they
were
so
many
separate
worlds
the
first
of
which
is
powerless
to
exercise
influence
on
the
second
still
the
latter
is
meant
to
influence
the
former
that
is
to
say
the
concept
of
freedom
is
meant
to
actualize
in
the
sensible
world
the
end
proposed
by
its
laws
and
nature
must
consequently
also
be
capable
of
being
regarded
in
such
a
way
that
in
the
conformity
to
law
of
its
form
it
at
least
harmonizes
with
the
possibility
of
the
ends
to
be
effectuated
in
it
according
to
the
laws
of
freedom
there
must
therefore
be
a
ground
of
the
unity
of
the
supersensible
that
lies
at
the
basis
of
nature
with
what
the
concept
of
freedom
contains
in
a
practical
way
and
although
the
concept
of
this
ground
neither
theoretically
nor
practically
attains
to
a
knowledge
of
it
and
so
has
no
peculiar
realm
of
its
own
still
it
renders
possible
the
transition
from
the
mode
of
thought
according
to
the
principles
of
the

to

the
critique
of
judgement
as

two
parts
of
philosophy
in
a
whole
intro
paragraph

the
critique
which
deals
with
what
our
cognitive
faculties
are
capable
of
yielding
a
priori
has
properly
speaking
no
realm
in
respect
of
objects
for
it
is
not
a
doctrine
its
sole
business
being
to
investigate
whether
having
regard
to
the
general
bearings
of
our
faculties
a
doctrine
is
possible
by
their
means
and
if
so
how
its
field
extends
to
all
their
pretentions
with
a
view
to
confining
them
within
their
legitimate
bounds
but
what
is
shut
out
of
the
division
of
philosophy
may
still
be
admitted
as
a
principal
part
into
the
general
critique
of
our
faculty
of
pure
cognition
in
the
event
namely
of
its
containing
principles
which
are
not
in
themselves
available
either
for
theoretical
or
practical
employment
concepts
of
nature
contain
the
ground
of
all
theoretical
cognition
a
priori
and
rest
as
we
saw
upon
the
legislative
authority
of
understanding
the
concept
of
freedom
contains
the
ground
of
all
sensuously
unconditioned
practical
precepts
a
priori
and
rests
upon
that
of
reason
both
faculties
therefore
besides
their
application
in
point
of
logical
form
to
principles
of
whatever
origin
have
in
addition
their
own
peculiar
jurisdiction
in
the
matter
of
their
content
and
so
there
being
no
further
a
priori
jurisdiction
above
them
the
division
of
philosophy
into
theoretical
and
practical
is
justified
but
there
is
still
further
in
the
family
of
our
higher
cognitive
faculties
a
middle
term
between
understanding
and
reason
this
is
judgement
of
which
we
may
reasonably
presume
by
analogy
that
it
may
likewise
contain
if
not
a
special
authority
to
prescribe
laws
still
a
principle
peculiar
to
itself
upon
which
laws
are
sought
although
one
merely
subjective
a
priori
this
principle
even
if
it
has
no
field
of
objects
appropriate
to
it
as
its
realm
may
still
have
some
territory
or
other
with
a
certain
character
for
which
just
this
very
principle
alone
may
be
valid
but
in
addition
to
the
above
considerations
there
is
yet
to
judge
by
analogy
a
further
ground
upon
which
judgement
may
be
brought
into
line
with
another
arrangement
of
our
powers
of
representation
and
one
that
appears
to
be
of
even
greater
importance
than
that
of
its
kinship
with
the
family
of
cognitive
faculties
for
all
faculties
of
the
soul
or
capacities
are
reducible
to
three
which
do
not
admit
of
any
further
derivation
from
a
common
ground
the
faculty
of
knowledge
the
feeling
of
pleasure
or
displeasure
and
the
faculty
of
desire
for
the
faculty
of
cognition
understanding
alone
is
legislative
if
as
must
be
the
case
where
it
is
considered
on
its
own
account
free
of
confusion
with
the
faculty
of
desire
this
faculty
as
that
of
theoretical
cognition
is
referred
to
nature
in
respect
of
which
alone
as
phenomenon
it
is
possible
for
us
to
prescribe
laws
by
means
of
a
priori
concepts
of
nature
which
are
properly
pure
concepts
of
understanding
for
the
faculty
of
desire
as
a
higher
faculty
operating
under
the
concept
of
freedom
only
reason
in
which
alone
this
concept
has
a
place
prescribes
laws
a
priori
now
between
the
faculties
of
knowledge
and
desire
stands
the
feeling
of
pleasure
just
as
judgement
is
intermediate
between
understanding
and
reason
hence
we
may
provisionally
at
least
assume
that
judgement
likewise
contains
an
a
priori
principle
of
its
own
and
that
since
pleasure
or
displeasure
is
necessarily
combined
with
the
faculty
of
desire
be
it
antecedent
to
its
principle
as
with
the
lower
desires
or
as
with
the
higher

supervening
upon
its
determination
by
the
moral
law

will
effect
a

the

from
the

of

one
has

pure

it
is
worth
while
attempting
in

of
this
connection
to
give

a
transcendental
definition
a

of

the

thus
generalizes

solution
i
have
been
taken
to
task
for
adopting
a
similar
procedure
and
fault
had
been
found
with
my
definition
of
the
faculty
of
desire
as
a
faculty
which
by

of
its
representations
is
the
cause
of
the
cause
of
the

in

every
one
is
ready
to
abandon
all
claim
to
being
able
by

of
them
alone
to
call
their

into
existence
but
this
proves
no
more
than
the
presence
of
desires
in
man
by
which
he
is
in
contradiction
with
himself
for
in
such

case
he
seeks
the
production
of
the

of
their

is
still
involved
in
every
wish
a
reference
of
the

therefore
the
representation
of

this
is

where
the

that
a

is
kept
on
being
exerted

exerted
on
these

that
the

not

can
deter
from
straining
towards
it

why
our
nature
should
be

with
a
propensity

vain

a

only
the

of
three
parts
the
critique
of
pure
understanding
of
pure

of
pure

iv
judgement
as
a
faculty
by
which

intro
paragraph

prescribed
a
priori
judgement
in
general
is
the
faculty
of
thinking
the
particular
as
contained
under
the
universal
if
the
universal
the
rule
principle
or
law
is
given
then
the
judgement
which
subsumes
the
particular
under
it
is
determinant
this
is
so
even
where
such
a
judgement
is
transcendental
and
as
such
provides
the
conditions
a
priori
in
conformity
with
which
alone
subsumption
under
that
universal
can
be
effected
if
however
only
the
particular
is
given
and
the
universal
has
to
be
found
for
it
then
the
judgement
is
simply
reflective
the
determinant
judgement
determines
under
universal
transcendental
laws
furnished
by
understanding
and
is
subsumptive
only
the
law
is
marked
out
for
it
a
priori
and
it
has
no
need
to
devise
a
law
for
its
own
guidance
to
enable
it
to
subordinate
the
particular
in
nature
to
the
universal
but
there
are
such
manifold
forms
of
nature
so
many
modifications
as
it
were
of
the
universal
transcendental
concepts
of
nature
left
undetermined
by
the
laws
furnished
by
pure
understanding
a
priori
as
above
mentioned
and
for
the
reason
that
these
laws
only
touch
the
general
possibility
of
a
nature
as
an
object
of
sense
that
there
must
needs
also
be
laws
in
this
behalf
these
laws
being
empirical
may
be
contingent
as
far
as
the
light
of
our
understanding
goes
but
still
if
they
are
to
be
called
laws
as
the
concept

unknown

it
be
to
us

the
unity
of
the
manifold
the
reflective
judgement
which
is
compelled
to
ascend
from
the
particular
in
nature
to
the
universal
stands
therefore
in
need
of
a
principle
this
principle
it
cannot
borrow
from
experience
because
what
it
has
to
do
is
to
establish
just
the
unity
of
all
empirical
principles
under
higher
though
likewise
empirical
principles
and
thence
the
possibility
of
the
systematic
subordination
of
higher
and
lower
such
a
transcendental
principle
therefore
the
reflective
judgement
can
only
give
as
a
law
from
and
to
itself
it
cannot
derive
it
from
any
other
quarter
as
it
would
then
be
a
determinant
judgement
nor
can
it
prescribe
it
to
nature
for
reflection
on
the
laws
of
nature
adjusts
itself
to
nature
and
not
nature
to
the
conditions
according
to
which
we
strive
to
obtain
a
concept
of
it
a
concept
that
is
quite
contingent
in
respect
of
these
conditions
now
the
principle
sought
can
only
be
this
as
universal
laws
of
nature
have
their
ground
in
our
understanding
which
prescribes
them
to
nature
though
only
according
to
the
universal
concept
of
it
as
nature
particular
empirical
laws
must
be
regarded
in
respect
of
that
which
is
left
undetermined
in
them
by
these
universal
laws
according
to
a
unity
such
as
they
would
have
if
an
understanding
though
it
be
not
ours
had
supplied
them
for
the
benefit
of
our
cognitive
faculties
so
as
to
render
possible
a
system
of
experience
according
to
particular
natural
laws
this
is
not
to
be
taken
as
implying
that
such
an
understanding
must
be
actually
assumed
for
it
is
only
the
reflective
judgement
which
avails
itself
of
this
idea
as
a
principle
for
the
purpose
of
reflection
and
not
for
determining
anything
but
this
faculty
rather
gives
by
this
means
a
law
to
itself
alone
and
not
to
nature

now
the
concept
of
an
object
so
far
as
it
contains
at
the
same
time
the
ground
of
the
actuality
of
this
object
is
called
its
end
and
the
agreement
of
a
thing
with
that
constitution
of
things
which
is
only
possible
according
to
ends
is
called
the
finality
of
its
form
accordingly
the
principle
of
judgement
in
respect
of
the
form
of
the
things
of
nature
under
empirical
laws
generally
is
the
finality
of
nature
in
its
multiplicity
in
other
words
by
this
concept
nature
is
represented
as
if
an
understanding
contained
the
ground
of
the
unity
of
the
manifold
of
its
empirical
laws
the
finality
of
nature
is
therefore
a
particular
a
priori
concept
which
bas
its
origin
solely
in
the
reflective
judgement
for
we
cannot
ascribe
to
the
products
of
nature
anything
like
a
reference
of
nature
in
them
to
ends
but
we
can
only
make
use
of
this
concept
to
reflect
upon
them
in
respect
of
the
nexus
of
phenomena
in
nature
a
nexus
given
according
to
empirical
laws
furthermore
this
concept
is
entirely
different
from
practical
finality
in
human
art
or
even
morals
though
it
is
doubtless
thought
after
this
analogy
v
the
principle
of
the
formal
finality
of

a
transcendental
principle
of

intro
paragraph

a
transcendental
principle
is
one
through
which
we
represent
a
priori
the
universal
condition
under
which
alone
things
can
become
objects
of
our
cognition
generally
a
principle
on
the
other
band
is
called
metaphysical
where
it
represents
a
priori
the
condition
under
which
alone
objects
whose
concept
has
to
be
given
empirically
may
become
further
determined
a
priori
thus
the
principle
of
the
cognition
of
bodies
as
substances
and
as
changeable
substances
is
transcendental
where
the
statement
is
that
their
change
must
have
a
cause
but
it
is
metaphysical
where
it
asserts
that
their
change
must
have
an
external
cause
for
in
the
first
case
bodies
need
only
be
thought
through
ontological
predicates
pure
concepts
of
understanding
e
g
as
substance
to
enable
the
proposition
to
be
cognized
a
priori
whereas
in
the
second
case
the
empirical
concept
of
a
body
as
a
movable
thing
in
space
must
be
introduced
to
support
the
proposition
although
once
this
is
done
it
may
be
seen
quite
a
priori
that
the
latter
predicate
movement
only
by
means
of
an
external
cause
applies
to
body
in
this
way
as
i
shall
show
presently
the
principle
of
the
finality
of
nature
in
the
multiplicity
of
its
empirical
laws
is
a
transcendental
principle
for
the
concept
of
objects
regarded
as
standing
under
this
principle
is
only
the
pure
concept
of
objects
of
possible
empirical
cognition
generally
and
involves
nothing
empirical
on
the
other
band
the
principle
of
practical
finality
implied
in
the
idea
of
the
determination
of
a
free
will
would
be
a
metaphysical
principle
because
the
concept
of
a
faculty
of
desire
as
will
has
to
be
given
empirically
i
e
is
not
included
among
transcendental
predicates
but
both
these
principles
are
none
the
less
not
empirical
but
a
priori
principles
because
no
further
experience
is
required
for
the
synthesis
of
the
predicate
with
the
empirical
concept
of
the
subject
of
their
judgements
but
it
may
be
apprehended
quite
a
priori
that
the
concept
of
a
finality
of
nature
belongs
to
transcendental
principles
is
abundantly
evident
from
the
maxims
of
judgement
upon
which
we
rely
a
priori
in
the
investigation
of
nature
and
which
yet
have
to
do
with
no
more
than
the
possibility
of
experience
and
consequently
of
the
knowledge
of
nature
but
of
nature
not
merely
in
a
general
way
but
as
determined
by
a
manifold
of
particular
laws
these
maxims
crop
up
frequently
enough
in
the
course
of
this
science
though
only
in
a
scattered
way
they
are
aphorisms
of
metaphysical
wisdom
making
their
appearance
in
a
number
of
rules
the
necessity
of
which
cannot
be
demonstrated
from
concepts
nature
takes
the
shortest
way
lex
parsimoniae
yet
it
makes
no
leap
either
in
the
sequence
of
its
changes
or
in
the
juxtaposition
of
specifically
different
forms
lex
continui
in
natura
its
vast
variety
in
empirical
laws
is
for
all
that
unity
under
a
few
principles
principia
praeter
necessitatem
non
sunt
multiplicanda
and
so
forth
if
we
propose
to
assign
the
origin
of
these
elementary
rules
and
attempt
to
do
so
on
psychological
lines
we
go
straight
in
the
teeth
of
their
sense
for
they
tell
us
not
what
happens
i
e
according
to
what
rule
our
powers
of
judgement
actually
discharge
their
functions
and
how
we
judge
but
how
we
ought
to
judge
and
we
cannot
get
this
logical
objective
necessity
where
the
principles
are
merely
empirical
hence
the
finality
of
nature
for
our
cognitive
faculties
and
their
employment
which
manifestly
radiates
from
them
is
a
transcendental
principle
of
judgements
and
so
needs
also
a
transcendental
deduction
by
means
of
which
the
ground
for
this
mode
of
judging
must
be
traced
to
the
a
priori
sources
of
knowledge
now
looking
at
the
grounds
of
the
possibility
of
an
experience
the
first
thing
of
course
that
meets
us
is
something
necessary
namely
the
universal
laws
apart
from
which
nature
in
general
as
an
object
of
sense
cannot
be
thought
these
rest
on
the
categories
applied
to
the
formal
conditions
of
all
intuition
possible
for
us
so
far
as
it
is
also
given
a
priori
under
these
laws
judgement
is
determinant
for
it
bas
nothing
else
to
do
than
to
subsume
under
given
laws
for
instance
understanding
says
all
change
has
its
cause
universal
law
of
nature
transcendental
judgement
has
nothing
further
to
do
than
to
furnish
a
priori
the
condition
of
subsumption
under
the
concept
of
understanding
placed
before
it
this
we
get
in
the
succession
of
the
determinations
of
one
and
the
same
thing
now
for
nature
in
general
as
an
object
of
possible
experience
that
law
is
cognized
as
absolutely
necessary
but
besides
this
formal
time
condition
the
objects
of
empirical
cognition
are
determined
or
so
far
as
we
can
judge
a
priori
are
determinable
in
divers
ways
so
that
specifically
differentiated
natures
over
and
above
what
they
have
in
common
as
things
of
nature
in
general
are
further
capable
of
being
causes
in
an
infinite
variety
of
ways
and
each
of
these
modes
must
on
the
concept
of
a
cause
in
general
have
its
rule
which
is
a
law
and
consequently
imports
necessity
although
owing
to
the
constitution
and
limitations
of
our
faculties
of
cognition
we
may
entirely
fail
to
see
this
necessity
accordingly
in
respect
of
natures
merely
empirical
laws
we
must
think
in
nature
a
possibility
of
an
endless
multiplicity
of
empirical
laws
which
yet
are
contingent
so
far
as
our
insight
goes
i
e
cannot
be
cognized
a
priori
in
respect
of
these
we
estimate
the
unity
of
nature
according
to
empirical
laws
and
the
possibility
of
the
unity
of
experience
as
a
system
according
to
empirical
laws
to
be
contingent
but
now
such
a
unity
is
one
which
must
be
necessarily
presupposed
and
assumed
as
otherwise
we
should
not
have
a
thoroughgoing
connection
of
empirical
cognition
in
a
whole
of
experience
for
the
universal
laws
of
nature
while
providing
certainly
for
such
a
connection
among
things
generically
as
things
of
nature
in
general
do
not
do
so
for
them
specifically
as
such
particular
things
of
nature
hence
judgement
is
compelled
for
its
own
guidance
to
adopt
it
as
an
a
priori
principle
that
what
is
for
human
insight
contingent
in
the
particular
empirical
laws
of
nature
contains
nevertheless
unity
of
law
in
the
synthesis
of
its
manifold
in
an
intrinsically
possible
experience
unfathomable
though
still
thinkable
as
such
unity
may
no
doubt
be
for
us
consequently
as
the
unity
of
law
in
a
synthesis
which
is
cognized
by
us
in
obedience
to
a
necessary
aim
a
need
of
understanding
though
recognized
at
the
same
time
as
contingent
is
represented
as
a
finality
of
objects
here
of
nature
so
judgement
which
in
respect
of
things
under
possible
yet
to
be
discovered
empirical
laws
is
merely
reflective
must
regard
nature
in
respect
of
the
latter
according
to
a
principle
of
finality
for
our
cognitive
faculty
which
then
finds
expression
in
the
above
maxims
of
judgement
now
this
transcendental
concept
of
a
finality
of
nature
is
neither
a
concept
of
nature
nor
of
freedom
since
it
attributes
nothing
at
all
to
the
object
i
e
to
nature
but
only
represents
the
unique
mode
in
which
we
must
proceed
in
our
reflection
upon
the
objects
of
nature
with
a
view
to
getting
a
thoroughly
interconnected
whole
of
experience
and
so
is
a
subjective
principle
i
e
maxim
of
judgement
for
this
reason
too
just
as
if
it
were
a
lucky
chance
that
favoured
us
we
are
rejoiced
properly
speaking
relieved
of
a
want
where
we
meet
with
such
systematic
unity
under
merely
empirical
laws
although
we
must
necessarily
assume
the
presence
of
such
a
unity
apart
from
any
ability
on
our
part
to
apprehend
or
prove
its
existence
intro
paragraph

in
order
to
convince
ourselves
of
the
correctness
of
this
deduction
of
the
concept
before
us
and
the
necessity
of
assuming
it
as
a
transcendental
principle
of
cognition
let
us
just
bethink
ourselves
of
the
magnitude
of
the
task
we
have
to
form
a
connected
experience
from
given
perceptions
of
a
nature
containing
a
maybe
endless
multiplicity
of
empirical
laws
and
this
problem
has
its
seat
a
priori
in
our
understanding
this
understanding
is
no
doubt
a
priori
in
possession
of
universal
laws
of
nature
apart
from
which
nature
would
be
incapable
of
being
an
object
of
experience
at
all
but
over
and
above
this
it
needs
a
certain
order
of
nature
in
its
particular
rules
which
are
only
capable
of
being
brought
to
its
knowledge
empirically
and
which
so
far
as
it
is
concerned
are
contingent
these
rules
without
which
we
would
have
no
means
of
advance
from
the
universal
analogy
of
a
possible
experience
in
general
to
a
particular
must
be
regarded
by
understanding
as
laws
i
e
as
necessary
for
otherwise
they
would
not
form
an
order
of
nature
though
it
be
unable
to
cognize
or
ever
get
an
insight
into
their
necessity
albeit
then
it
can
determine
nothing
a
priori
in
respect
of
these
objects
it
must
in
pursuit
of
such
empirical
so
called
laws
lay
at
the
basis
of
all
reflection
upon
them
an
a
priori
principle
to
the
effect
namely
that
a
cognizable
order
of
nature
is
possible
according
to
them
a
principle
of
this
kind
is
expressed
in
the
following
propositions
there
is
in
nature
a
subordination
of
genera
and
species
comprehensible
by
us
each
of
these
genera
again
approximates
to
the
others
on
a
common
principle
so
that
a
transition
may
be
possible
from
one
to
the
other
and
thereby
to
a
higher
genus
while
it
seems
at
outset
unavoidable
for
our
understanding
to
assume
for
the
specific
variety
of
natural
operations
a
like
number
of
various
kinds
of
causality
yet
these
may
all
be
reduced
to
a
small
number
of
principles
the
quest
for
which
is
our
business
and
so
forth
this
adaptation
of
nature
to
our
cognitive
faculties
is
presupposed
a
priori
by
judgement
on
behalf
of
its
reflection
upon
it
according
to
empirical
laws
but
understanding
all
the
while
recognizes
it
objectively
as
contingent
and
it
is
merely
judgement
that
attributes
it
to
nature
as
transcendental
finality
i
e
a
finality
in

of
the
subjects

of
cognition
for
were
it
not
for
this
presupposition
we
should
have
no
order
of
nature
in
accordance
with
empirical
laws
and
consequently
no
guiding
thread
for
an
experience
that
has
to
be
brought
to
bear
upon
these
in
all
their
variety
or
for
an
investigation
of
them
for
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
despite
all
the
uniformity
of
the
things
of
nature
according
to
universal
laws
without
which
we
would
not
have
the
form
of
general
empirical
knowledge
at
all
the
specific
variety
of
the
empirical
laws
of
nature
with
their
effects
might
still
be
so
great
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
our
understanding
to
discover
in
nature
an
intelligible
order
to
divide
its
products
into
genera
and
species
so
as
to
avail
ourselves
of
the
principles
of
explanation
and
comprehension
of
one
for
explaining
and
interpreting
another
and
out
of
material
coming
to

in
such
confusion
properly
speaking
only
infinitely
multiform
and
ill
adapted
to
our
power
of
apprehension
to
make
a
consistent
context
of
experience
thus
judgement
also
is
equipped
with
an
a
priori
principle
for
the
possibility
of
nature
but
only
in
a
subjective
respect
by
means
of
this
it
prescribes
a
law
not
to
nature
as
autonomy
but
to
itself
as

guide
its
reflection
upon

this
law
may
be
called
the
law
of
the
specification
of
nature
in

of
its
empirical

it
is
not
one
cognized
a

in
nature
but
judgement
adopts
it
in
the
interests
of
a
natural
order
cognizable
by
our
understanding

the
division
which
it
makes
of
natures

when
it
seeks
to
subordinate
to
them
a
variety
of
particular
laws
so
when
it
is
said
that

specifies
its
universal
laws
on
a
principle
of
finality
for
our
cognitive

i
e
of
suitability
for
the
human
understanding
and
its
necessary
function
of
finding
the
universal
for

presented
to
it
by
perception
and
again
for
varieties
which
are
of
course
common
for
each
species

in
the
unity
of
principle
we
do
not
thereby
either
prescribe
a
law
to
nature
or
learn
one
from
it
by
observation
although
the
principle
in
question
may
be
confirmed
by
this
means
for
it
is
not
a
principle
of
the
determinant
but
merely
of
the

judgement
all
that
is
intended
is
that
no
matter
what
is
the
order
and
disposition
of
nature
in

of
its
universal
laws
we
must
investigate
its
empirical

thereon

particular
laws
with
our
need
of
finding
universality
of
principles
for
it
must
so
far
as
our
insight
goes
be
deemed
contingent
but
withal
indispensable
for
the
requirements
of
our
understanding
and
consequently
a
finality
by
which
nature
is
in
accord
with
our
aim
but
only
so
far
as
this
is
directed
to
knowledge
the
universal
laws
of
understanding
which
are
equally
laws
of
nature
are
although
arising
from
spontaneity
just
as
necessary
for
nature
as
the
laws
of
motion
applicable
to
matter
their
origin
does
not
presuppose
any
regard
to
our
cognitive
faculties
seeing
that
it
is
only
by
their
means
that
we
first
come
by
any
conception
of
the
meaning
of
a
knowledge
of
things
of
nature
and
they
of
necessity
apply
to
nature
as
object
of
our
cognition
in
general
but
it
is
contingent
so
far
as
we
can
see
that
the
order
of
nature
in
its
particular
laws
with
their
wealth
of
at
least
possible
variety
and
heterogeneity
transcending
all
our
powers
of
comprehension
should
still
in
actual
fact
be
commensurate
with
these
powers
to
find
out
this
order
is
an
undertaking
on
the
part
of
our
understanding
which
pursues
it
with
a
regard
to
a
necessary
end
of
its
own
that
namely
of
introducing
into
nature
unity
of
principle
this
end
must
then
be
attributed
to
nature
by
judgement
since
no
law
can
be
here
prescribed
to
it
by
understanding
the
attainment
of
every
aim
is
coupled
with
a
feeling
of
pleasure
now
where
such
attainment
has
for
its
condition
a
representation
a
priori
as
here
a
principle
for
the
reflective
judgement
in
general
the
feeling
of
pleasure
also
is
determined
by
a
ground
which
is
a
priori
and
valid
for
all
men
and
that
too
merely
by
virtue
of
the
reference
of
the
object
to
our
faculty
of
cognition
as
the
concept
of
finality
here
takes
no
cognizance
whatever
of
the
faculty
of
desire
it
differs
entirely
from
all
practical
finality
of
nature
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
do
not
and
cannot
find
in
ourselves
the
slightest
effect
on
the
feeling
of
pleasure
from
the
coincidence
of
perceptions
with
the
laws
in
accordance
with
the
universal
concepts
of
nature
the
categories
since
in
their
case
understanding
necessarily
follows
the
bent
of
its
own
nature
without
ulterior
aim
but
while
this
is
so
the
discovery
on
the
other
hand
that
two
or
more
empirical
heterogeneous
laws
of
nature
are
allied
under
one
principle
that
embraces
them
both
is
the
ground
of
a
very
appreciable
pleasure
often
even
of
admiration
and
such
too
as
does
not
wear
off
even
though
we
are
already
familiar
enough
with
its
object
it
is
true
that
we
no
longer
notice
any
decided
pleasure
in
the
comprehensibility
of
nature
or
in
the
unity
of
its
divisions
into
genera
and
species
without
which
the
empirical
concepts
that
afford
us
our
knowledge
of
nature
in
its
particular
laws
would
not
be
possible
still
it
is
certain
that
the
pleasure
appeared
in
due
course
and
only
by
reason
of
the
most
ordinary
experience
being
impossible
without
it
bas
it
become
gradually
fused
with
simple
cognition
and
no
longer
arrests
particular
attention
something
then
that
makes
us
attentive
in
our
estimate
of
nature
to
its
finality
for
our
understanding
an
endeavour
to
bring
where
possible
its
heterogeneous
laws
under
higher
though
still
always
empirical
laws
is
required
in
order
that
on
meeting
with
success
pleasure
may
be
felt
in
this
their
accord
with
our
cognitive
faculty
which
accord
is
regarded
by
us
as
purely
contingent
as
against
this
a
representation
of
nature
would
be
altogether
displeasing
to
us
were
we
to
be
forewarned
by
it
that
on
the
least
investigation
carried
beyond
the
commonest
experience
we
should
come
in
contact
with
such
a
heterogeneity
of
its
laws
as
would
make
the
union
of
its
particular
laws
under
universal
empirical
laws
impossible
for
our
understanding
for
this
would
conflict
with
the
principle
of
the
subjectively
final
specification
of
nature
in
its
genera
and
with
our
own
reflective
judgement
in
respect
thereof
intro
paragraph

yet
this
presupposition
of
judgement
is
so
indeterminate
on
the
question
of
the
extent
of
the
prevalence
of
that
ideal
finality
of
nature
for
our
cognitive
faculties
that
if
we
are
told
that
a
more
searching
or
enlarged
knowledge
of
nature
derived
from
observation
must
eventually
bring
us
into
contact
with
a
multiplicity
of
laws
that
no
human
understanding
could
reduce
to
a
principle
we
can
reconcile
ourselves
to
the
thought
but
still
we
listen
more
gladly
to
others
who
hold
out
to
us
the
hope
that
the
more
intimately
we
come
to
know
the
secrets
of
nature
or
the
better
we
are
able
to
compare
it
with
external
members
as
yet
unknown
to
us
the
more
simple
shall
we
find
it
in
its
principles
and
the
further
our
experience
advances
the
more
harmonious
shall
we
find
it
in
the
apparent
heterogeneity
of
its
empirical
laws
for
our
judgement
makes
it
imperative
upon
us
to
proceed
on
the
principle
of
the
conformity
of
nature
to
our
faculty
of
cognition
so
far
as
that
principle
extends
without
deciding
for
the
rule
is
not
given
to
us
by
a
determinant
judgement
whether
bounds
are
anywhere
set
to
it
or
not
for
while
in

of
the
rational
employment
of
our
cognitive
faculty
bounds
may
be
definitely

that

subjective
in

constitutes

in

representation
of

the
quality
of
space
in
which
we
intuite
them
is
the
merely
subjective
side
of
my
representation
of
them
by
which
what
the
things
are
in
themselves
as
objects
is
left
quite
open
and
it
is
on
account
of
that
reference
that
the
object
in
being
intuited
in
space
is
also
thought
merely
as
phenomenon
but
despite
its
purely
subjective
quality
space
is
still
a
constituent
of
the
knowledge
of
things
as
phenomena
sensation
here
external
also
agrees
in
expressing
a
merely
subjective
side
of
our
representations
of
external
things
but
one
which
is
properly
their
matter
through
which
we
are
given
something
with
real
existence
just
as
space
is
the
mere
a
priori
form
of
the
possibility
of
their
intuition
and
so
sensation
is
none
the
less
also
employed
in
the
cognition
of
external
objects
but
that
subjective
side
of
a
representation
which
is
incapable
of
becoming
an
element
of
cognition
is
the
pleasure
or
displeasure
connected
with
it
for
through
it
i
cognize
nothing
in
the
object
of
the
representation
although
it
may
easily
be
the
result
of
the
operation
of
some
cognition
or
other
now
the
finality
of
a
thing
so
far
as
represented
in
our
perception
of
it
is
in
no
way
a
quality
of
the
object
itself
for
a
quality
of
this
kind
is
not
one
that
can
be
perceived
although
it
may
be
inferred
from
a
cognition
of
things
in
the
finality
therefore
which
is
prior
to
the
cognition
of
an
object
and
which
even
apart
from
any
desire
to
make
use
of
the
representation
of
it
for
the
purpose
of
a
cognition
is
yet
immediately
connected
with
it
we
have
the
subjective
quality
belonging
to
it
that
is
incapable
of
becoming
a
constituent
of
knowledge
hence
we
only
apply
the
term
final
to
the
object
on
account
of
its
representation
being
immediately
coupled
with
the
feeling
of
pleasure
and
this
representation
itself
is
an
aesthetic
representation
of
the
finality
the
only
question
is
whether
such
a
representation
of
finality
exists
at
all
if
pleasure
is
connected
with
the
mere
apprehension
apprehensio
of
the
form
of
an
object
of
intuition
apart
from
any
reference
it
may
have
to
a
concept
for
the
purpose
of
a
definite
cognition
this
does
not
make
the
representation
referable
to
the
object
but
solely
to
the
subject
in
such
a
case
the
pleasure
can
express
nothing
but
the
conformity
of
the
object
to
the
cognitive
faculties
brought
into
play
in
the
reflective
judgement
and
so
far
as
they
are
in
play
and
hence
merely
a
subjective
formal
finality
of
the
object
for
that
apprehension
of
forms
in
the
imagination
can
never
take
place
without
the
reflective
judgement
even
when
it
has
no
intention
of
so
doing
comparing
them
at
least
with
its
faculty
of
referring
intuitions
to
concepts
if
now
in
this
comparison
imagination
as
the
faculty
of
intuitions
a
priori
is
undesignedly
brought
into
accord
with
understanding
as
the
faculty
of
concepts
by
means
of
a
given
representation
and
a
feeling
of
pleasure
is
thereby
aroused
then
the
object
must
be
regarded
as
final
for
the
reflective
judgement
a
judgement
of
this
kind
is
an
aesthetic
judgement
upon
the
finality
of
the
object
which
does
not
depend
upon
any
present
concept
of
the
object
and
does
not
provide
one
when
the
form
of
an
object
as
opposed
to
the
matter
of
its
representation
as
sensation
is
in
the
mere
act
of
reflecting
upon
it
without
regard
to
any
concept
to
be
obtained
from
it
estimated
as
the
ground
of
a
pleasure
in
the
representation
of
such
an
object
then
this
pleasure
is
also
judged
to
be
combined
necessarily
with
the
representation
of
it
and
so
not
merely
for
the
subject
apprehending
this
form
but
for
all
in
general
who
pass
judgement
the
object
is
then
called
beautiful
and
the
faculty
of
judging
by
means
of
such
a
pleasure
and
so
also
with
universal
validity
is
called
taste
for
since
the
ground
of
the
pleasure
is
made
to
reside
merely
in
the
form
of
the
object
for
reflection
generally
consequently
not
in
any
sensation
of
the
object
and
without
any
reference
either
to
any
concept
that
might
have
something
or
other
in
view
it
is
with
the
conformity
to
law
in
the
empirical
employment
of
judgement
generally
unity
of
imagination
and
understanding
in
the
subject
and
with
this
alone
that
the
representation
of
the
object
in
reflection
the
conditions
of
which
are
universally
valid
a
priori
accords
and
as
this
accordance
of
the
object
with
the
faculties
of
the
subject
is
contingent
it
gives
rise
to
a
representation
of
a
finality
on
the
part
of
the
object
in
respect
of
the
cognitive
faculties
of
the
subject
here
now
is
a
pleasure
which
as
is
the
case
with
all
pleasure
or
displeasure
that
is
not
brought
about
through
the
agency
of
the
concept
of
freedom
i
e
through
the
antecedent
determination
of
the
higher
faculty
of
desire
by
means
of
pure
reason
no
concepts
could
ever
enable
us
to
regard
as
necessarily
connected
with
the
representation
of
an
object
it
must
always
be
only
through
reflective
perception
that
it
is
cognized
as
conjoined
with
this
representation
as
with
all
empirical
judgements
it
is
consequently
unable
to
announce
objective
necessity
or
lay
claim
to
a
priori
validity
but
then
the
judgement
of
taste
in
fact
only
lays
claim
like
every
other
empirical
judgement
to
be
valid
for
every
one
and
despite
its
inner
contingency
this
is
always
possible
the
only
point
that
is
strange
or
out
of
the
way
about
it
is
that
it
is
not
an
empirical
concept
but
a
feeling
of
pleasure
and
so
not
a
concept
at
all
that
is
yet
exacted
from
every
one
by
the
judgement
of
taste
just
as
if
it
were
a
predicate
united
to
the
cognition
of
the
object
and
that
is
meant
to
be
conjoined
with
its
representation
a
singular
empirical
judgement
as
for
example
the
judgement
of
one
who
perceives
a
movable
drop
of
water
in
a
rock
crystal
rightly
looks
to
every
one
finding
the
fact
as
stated
since
the
judgement
has
been
formed
according
to
the
universal
conditions
of
the
determinant
judgement
under
the
laws
of
a
possible
experience
generally
in
the
same
way
one
who
feels
pleasure
in
simple
reflection
on
the
form
of
an
object
without
having
any
concept
in
mind
rightly
lays
claim
to
the
agreement
of
every
one
although
this
judgement
is
empirical
and
a
singular
judgement
for
the
ground
of
this
pleasure
is
found
in
the
universal
though
subjective
condition
of
reflective
judgements
namely
the
final
harmony
of
an
object
be
it
a
product
of
nature
or
of
art
with
the
mutual
relation
of
the
faculties
of
cognition
imagination
and
understanding
which
are
requisite
for
every
empirical
cognition
the
pleasure
in
judgements
of
taste
is
therefore
dependent
doubtless
on
an
empirical
representation
and
cannot
be
united
a
priori
to
any
concept
one
cannot
determine
a
priori
what
object
will
be
in
accordance
with
taste
or
not
one
must
find
out
the
object
that
is
so
but
then
it
is
only
made
the
determining
ground
of
this
judgement
by
virtue
of
our
consciousness
of
its
resting
simply
upon
reflection
and
the
universal
though
only
subjective
conditions
of
the
harmony
of
that
reflection
with
the
knowledge
of
objects
generally
for
which
the
form
of
the
object
is
final
intro
paragraph

this
is
why
judgements
of
taste
are
subjected
to
a
critique
in
respect
of
their
possibility
for
their
possibility
presupposes
an
a
priori
principle
although
that
principle
is
neither
a
cognitive
principle
for
understanding
nor
a
practical
principle
for
the
will
and
is
thus
in
no
way
determinant
a
priori
susceptibility
to
pleasure
arising
from
reflection
on
the
forms
of
things
whether
of
nature
or
of

betokens
however
not
only
a
finality
on
the
part
of
objects
in
their
relation
to
the
reflective
judgement
in
the
subject
in
accordance
with
the
concept
of

but
also
conversely
a
finality
on
the
part
of
the
subject
answering
to
the
concept
of
freedom
in
respect
of
the
form
or
even
formlessness
of
objects
the
result
is
that
the
aesthetic
judgement
refers
not
merely
as
a
judgement
of
taste
to
the
beautiful
but
also
as
springing
from
a
higher
intellectual
feeling
to
the
sublime

the
