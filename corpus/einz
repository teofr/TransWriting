to
my
sweetheart
marie
d
all
things
are
nothing
to
me
what
is
not
supposed
to
be
my
concern

first
and
foremost
the
good
cause
then
gods
cause
the
cause
of
mankind
of
truth
of
freedom
of
humanity
of
justice
further
the
cause
of
my
people
my
prince
my
fatherland
finally
even
the
cause
of
mind
and
a
thousand
other
causes
only
my
cause
is
never
to
be
my
concern
shame
on
the
egoist
who
thinks
only
of
himself
let
us
look
and
see
then
how
they
manage
their
concerns
they
for
whose
cause
we
are
to
labour
devote
ourselves
and
grow
enthusiastic
you
have
much
profound
information
to
give
about
god
and
have
for
thousands
of
years
searched
the
depths
of
the
godhead
and
looked
into
its
heart
so
that
you
can
doubtless
tell
us
how
god
himself
attends
to
gods
cause
which
we
are
called
to
serve
and
you
do
not
conceal
the
lords
doings
either
now
what
is
his
cause
has
he
as
is
demanded
of
us
made
an
alien
cause
the
cause
of
truth
or
love
his
own
you
are
shocked
by
this
misunderstanding
and
you
instruct
us
that
gods
cause
is
indeed
the
cause
of
truth
and
love
but
that
this
cause
cannot
be
called
alien
to
him
because
god
is
himself
truth
and
love
you
are
shocked
by
the
assumption
that
god
could
be
like
us
poor
worms
in
furthering
an
alien
cause
as
his
own
should
god
take
up
the
cause
of
truth
if
he
were
not
himself
truth
he
cares
only
for
his
cause
but
because
he
is
all
in
all
therefore
all
is
his
cause
but
we
we
are
not
all
in
all
and
our
cause
is
altogether
little
and
contemptible
therefore
we
must
serve
a
higher
cause
now
it
is
clear
god
cares
only
for
what
is
his
busies
himself
only
with
himself
thinks
only
of
himself
and
has
only
himself
before
his
eyes
woe
to
all
that
is
not
well
pleasing
to
him
he
serves
no
higher
person
and
satisfies
only
himself
his
cause
is
a
purely
egoistic
cause
how
is
it
with
mankind
whose
cause
we
are
to
make
our
own
is
its
cause
that
of
another
and
does
mankind
serve
a
higher
cause
no
mankind
looks
only
at
itself
mankind
will
promote
the
interests
of
mankind
only
mankind
is
its
own
cause
that
it
may
develop
it
causes
nations
and
individuals
to
wear
themselves
out
in
its
service
and
when
they
have
accomplished
what
mankind
needs
it
throws
them
on
the
dung
heap
of
history
in
gratitude
is
not
mankinds
cause
a
purely
egoistic
cause
i
have
no
need
to
take
up
each
thing
that
wants
to
throw
its
cause
on
us
and
show
that
it
is
occupied
only
with
itself
not
with
us
only
with
its
good
not
with
ours
look
at
the
rest
for
yourselves
do
truth
freedom
humanity
justice
desire
anything
else
than
that
you
grow
enthusiastic
and
serve
them
they
all
have
an
admirable
time
of
it
when
they
receive
zealous
homage
just
observe
the
nation
that
is
defended
by
devoted
patriots
the
patriots
fall
in
bloody
battle
or
in
the
fight
with
hunger
and
want
what
does
the
nation
care
for
that
by
the
manure
of
their
corpses
the
nation
comes
to
its
bloom
the
individuals
have
died
for
the
great
cause
of
the
nation
and
the
nation
sends
some
words
of
thanks
after
them
and
has
the
profit
of
it
i
call
that
a
paying
kind
of
egoism
but
only
look
at
that
sultan
who
cares
so
lovingly
for
his
people
is
he
not
pure
unselfishness
itself
and
does
he
not
hourly
sacrifice
himself
for
his
people
oh
yes
for
his
people
just
try
it
show
yourself
not
as
his
but
as
your
own
for
breaking
away
from
his
egoism
you
will
take
a
trip
to
jail
the
sultan
has
set
his
cause
on
nothing
but
himself
he
is
to
himself
all
in
all
he
is
to
himself
the
only
one
and
tolerates
nobody
who
would
dare
not
to
be
one
of
his
people
and
will
you
not
learn
by
these
brilliant
examples
that
the
egoist
gets
on
best
i
for
my
part
take
a
lesson
from
them
and
propose
instead
of
further
unselfishly
serving
those
great
egoists
rather
to
be
the
egoist
myself
god
and
mankind
have
concerned
themselves
for
nothing
for
nothing
but
themselves
let
me
then
likewise
concern
myself
for
myself
who
am
equally
with
god
the
nothing
of
all
others
who
am
my
all
who
am
the
only
one

if
god
if
mankind
as
you
affirm
have
substance
enough
in
themselves
to
be
all
in
all
to
themselves
then
i
feel
that
i
shall
still
less
lack
that
and
that
i
shall
have
no
complaint
to
make
of
my
emptiness
i
am
not
nothing
in
the
sense
of
emptiness
but
i
am
the
creative
nothing
the
nothing
out
of
which
i
myself
as
creator
create
everything
away
then
with
every
concern
that
is
not
altogether
my
concern
you
think
at
least
the
good
cause
must
be
my
concern
whats
good
whats
bad
why
i
myself
am
my
concern
and
i
am
neither
good
nor
bad
neither
has
meaning
for
me
the
divine
is
gods
concern
the
human
mans
my
concern
is
neither
the
divine
nor
the
human
not
the
true
good
just
free
etc
but
solely
what
is
mine
and
it
is
not
a
general
one
but
is
unique
as
i
am
unique
nothing
is
more
to
me
than
myself

the
supreme
being
says

man
has

says
bruno
bauer
let
us
take
a
more
careful
look
at
this
supreme
being
and
this
new
discovery
i
a
human
life
from
the
moment
when
he
catches
sight
of
the
light
of
the
world
a
man
seeks
to
find
out
himself
and
get
hold
of
himself
out
of
its
confusion
in
which
he
with
everything
else
is
tossed
about
in
motley
mixture
but
everything
that
comes
in
contact
with
the
child
defends
itself
in
turn
against
his
attacks
and
asserts
its
own
persistence
accordingly
because
each
thing
cares
for
itself
and
at
the
same
time
comes
into
constant
collision
with
other
things
the
combat
of
self
assertion
is
unavoidable
victory
or
defeat
q
between
the
two
alternatives
the
fate
of
the
combat
wavers
the
victor
becomes
the
lord
the
vanquished
one
the
subject
the
former
exercises
supremacy
and
rights
of
supremacy
the
latter
fulfils
in
awe
and
deference
the
duties
of
a
subject
but
both
remain
enemies
and
always
lie
in
wait
they
watch
for
each
others
weaknesses
q
children
for
those
of
their
parents
and
parents
for
those
of
their
children
their
fear
for
example
either
the
stick
conquers
the
man
or
the
man
conquers
the
stick
in
childhood
liberation
takes
the
direction
of
trying
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
things
to
get
at
what
is
back
of
things
therefore
we
spy
out
the
weak
points
of
everybody
for
which
it
is
well
known
children
have
a
sure
instinct
therefore
we
like
to
smash
things
like
to
rummage
through
hidden
corners
pry
after
what
is
covered
up
or
out
of
the
way
and
try
what
we
can
do
with
everything
when
we
once
get
at
what
is
back
of
the
things
we
know
we
are
safe
when
we
have
got
at
the
fact
that
the
rod
is
too
weak
against
our
obduracy
then
we
no
longer
fear
it
have
outgrown
it
back
of
the
rod
mightier
than
it
stands
our
q
obduracy
our
obdurate
courage
by
degrees
we
get
at
what
is
back
of
everything
that
was
mysterious
and
uncanny
to
us
the
mysteriousiy
dreaded
might
of
the
rod
the
fathers
stern
look
etc
and
back
of
all
we
find
our
ataraxia
q
our
imperturbability
intrepidity
our
counter
forces
our
odds
of
strength
our
invincibility
before
that
which
formerly
inspired
in
us
fear
and
deference
we
no
longer
retreat
shyly
but
take
courage
back
of
everything
we
find
our
courage
our
superiority
back
of
the
sharp
command
of
parents
and
authorities
stands
after
all
our
courageous
choice
or
our
outwitting
shrewdness
and
the
more
we
feel
ourselves
the
smaller
appears
that
which
before
seemed
invincible
and
what
is
our
trickery
shrewdness
courage
obduracy
what
else
but
q
mind

through
a
considerable
time
we
are
spared
a
fight
that
is
so
exhausting
later
q
the
fight
against
reason
the
fairest
part
of
childhood
passes
without
the
necessity
of
coming
to
blows
with
reason
we
care
nothing
at
all
about
it
do
not
meddle
with
it
admit
no
reason
we
are
not
to
be
persuaded
to
anything
by
conviction
and
are
deaf
to
good
arguments
and
principles
on
the
other
hand
coaxing
punishment
and
the
like
are
hard
for
us
to
resist
this
stem
life
and
death
combat
with
reason
enters
later
and
begins
a
new
phase
in
childhood
we
scamper
about
without
racking
our
brains
much
mind
is
the
name
of
the
first
self
discovery
the
first
undeification
of
the
divine
that
is
of
the
uncanny
the
spooks
the
powers
above
our
fresh
feeling
of
youth
this
feeling
of
self
now
defers
to
nothing
the
world
is
discredited
for
we
are
above
it
we
are
mind
now
for
the
first
time
we
see
that
hitherto
we
have
not
looked
at
the
world
intelligently
at
all
but
only
stared
at
it
we
exercise
the
beginnings
of
our
strength
on
natural
powers
we
defer
to
parents
as
a
natural
power
later
we
say
father
and
mother
are
to
be
forsaken
all
natural
power
to
be
counted
as
riven
they
are
vanquished
for
the
rational
the
intellectual
man
there
is
no
family
as
a
natural
power
a
renunciation
of
parents
brothers
etc
makes
its
appearance
if
these
are
born
again
as
intellectual
rational
powers
they
are
no
longer
at
all
what
they
were
before
and
not
only
parents
but
men
in
general
are
conquered
by
the
young
man
they
are
no
hindrance
to
him
and
are
no
longer
regarded
for
now
he
says
one
must
obey
god
rather
than
men
prom
this
high
stand
point
everything
earthly
recedes
into
contemptible
remoteness
for
the
stand
point
is
q
the
heavenly
the
attitude
is
now
altogether
reversed
the
youth
takes
up
an
intellectual
position
while
the
boy
who
did
not
yet
feel
himself
as
mind
grew
up
on
mindless
learning
the
former
does
not
try
to
get
hold
of
things
for
instance
to
get
into
his
head
the
data
of
history
but
of
the
thoughts
that
lie
hidden
in
things
and
so
therefore
of
the
spirit
of
history
on
the
other
hand
the
boy
understands
connections
no
doubt
but
not
ideas
the
spirit
therefore
he
strings
together
whatever
can
be
learned
without
proceeding
a
priori
and
theoretically
without
looking
for
ideas
as
in
childhood
one
had
to
overcome
the
resistance
of
the
laws
of
the
world
so
now
in
everything
that
he
proposes
he
is
met
by
an
objection
of
the
mind
of
reason
of
his
own
conscience
that
is
unreasonable
unchristian
unpatriotic
and
the
like
cries
conscience
to
us
and
q
frightens
us
away
from
it
not
the
might
of
the
avenging
eumenides
not
poseidons
wrath
not
god
far
as
he
sees
the
hidden
not
the
fathers
rod
of
punishment
do
we
fear
but
qconscience
we
run
after
our
thoughts
now
and
follow
their
commands
just
as
before
we
followed
parental
human
ones
our
course
of
action
is
determined
by
our
thoughts
ideas
conceptions
faith
as
it
is
in
childhood
by
the
commands
of
our
parents
for
all
that
we
were
already
thinking
when
we
were
children
only
our
thoughts
were
not
fleshless
abstract
absolute
that
is
nothing
but
thoughts
a
heaven
in
themselves
a
pure
world
of
thought
logical
thoughts
on
the
contrary
they
had
been
only
thoughts
that
we
had
about
a
thing
we
thought
of
the
thing
so
or
so
thus
we
may
have
thought
god
made
the
world
that
we
see
there
but
we
did
not
think
of
search
the
depths
of
the
godhead
itself
we
may
have
thought
that
is
the
truth
about
the
matter
but
we
do
not
think
of
truth
itself
nor
unite
into
one
sentence
god
is
truth
the
depths
of
the
godhead
who
is
truth
we
did
not
touch
over
such
purely
logical
theological
questions
what
is
truth
pilate
does
not
stop
though
he
does
not
therefore
hesitate
to
ascertain
in
an
individual
case
what
truth
there
is
in
the
thing
whether
the
thing
is
true
any
thought
bound
to
a
thing
is
not
yet
nothing
but
a
thought
absolute
thought
to
bring
to
light
the
pure
thought
or
to
be
of
its
party
is
the
delight
of
youth
and
all
the
shapes
of
light
in
the
world
of
thought
like
truth
freedom
humanity
man
illumine
and
inspire
the
youthful
soul
but
when
the
spirit
is
recognized
as
the
essential
thing
it
still
makes
a
difference
whether
the
spirit
is
poor
or
rich
and
therefore
one
seeks
to
become
rich
in
spirit
the
spirit
wants
to
spread
out
so
as
to
found
its
empire
q
an
empire
that
is
not
of
this
world
the
world
just
conquered
thus
then
it
longs
to
become
all
in
all
to
itself
for
although
i
am
spirit
i
am
not
yet
perfected
spirit
and
must
first
seek
the
complete
spirit
but
with
that
i
who
had
just
now
found
myself
as
spirit
lose
myself
again
at
once
bowing
before
the
complete
spirit
as
one
not
my
own
but
supernal
and
feeling
my
emptiness
spirit
is
the
essential
point
for
everything
to
be
sure
but
then
is
every
spirit
the
right
spirit
the
right
and
true
spirit
is
the
ideal
of
spirit
the
holy
spirit
it
is
not
my
or
your
spirit
but
just
q
an
ideal
supernal
one
it
is
god
god
is
spirit
and
this
supernal
father
in
heaven
gives
it
to
those
that
pray
to
him

the
man
is
distinguished
from
the
youth
by
the
fact
that
he
takes
the
world
as
it
is
instead
of
everywhere
fancying
it
amiss
and
wanting
to
improve
it
model
it
after
his
ideal
in
him
the
view
that
one
must
deal
with
the
world
according
to
his
interest
not
according
to
his
ideals
becomes
confirmed
so
long
as
one
knows
himself
only
as
spirit
and
feels
that
all
the
value
of
his
existence
consists
in
being
spirit
it
becomes
easy
for
the
youth
to
give
his
life
the
bodily
life
for
a
nothing
for
the
silliest
point
of
honour
so
long
it
is
only
thoughts
that
one
has
ideas
that
he
hopes
to
be
able
to
realize
some
day
when
he
has
found
a
sphere
of
action
thus
one
has
meanwhile
only
ideals
unexecuted
ideas
or
thoughts
not
till
one
has
fallen
in
love
with
his
corporeal
self
and
takes
a
pleasure
in
himself
as
a
living
flesh
and
blood
person
q
but
it
is
in
mature
years
in
the
man
that
we
find
it
so
q
not
till
then
has
one
a
personal
or
egoistic
interest
an
interest
not
only
of
our
spirit
for
instance
but
of
total
satisfaction
satisfaction
of
the
whole
chap
a
selfish
interest
just
compare
a
man
with
a
youth
and
see
if
he
will
not
appear
to
you
harder
less
magnanimous
more
selfish
is
he
therefore
worse
no
you
say
he
has
only
become
more
definite
or
as
you
also
call
it
more
practical
but
the
main
point
is
this
that
he
makes
himself
more
the
centre
than
does
the
youth
who
is
infatuated
about
other
things
for
example
god
fatherland
and
so
on
therefore
the
man
shows
a
second
self
discovery
the
youth
found
himself
as
spirit
and
lost
himself
again
in
the
general
spirit
the
complete
holy
spirit
man
mankind
q
in
short
all
ideals
the
man
finds
himself
as
embodied
spirit
boys
had
only
unintellectual
interests
those
interests
devoid
of
thoughts
and
ideas
youths
only
intellectual
ones
the
man
has
bodily
personal
egoistic
interests
if
the
child
has
not
an
object
that
it
can
occupy
itself
with
it
feels
ennui
for
it
does
not
yet
know
how
to
occupy
itself
with
itself
the
youth
on
the
contrary
throws
the
object
aside
because
for
him
thoughts
arose
out
of
the
object
he
occupies
himself
with
his
thoughts
his
dreams
occupies
himself
intellectually
or
his
mind
is
occupied
the
young
man
includes
everything
not
intellectual
under
the
contemptuous
name
of
externalities
if
he
nevertheless
sticks
to
the
most
trivial
externalities
such
as
the
customs
of
students
clubs
and
other
formalities
it
is
because
and
when
he
discovers
mind
in
them
when
they
are
symbols
to
him
as
i
find
myself
back
of
things
and
that
as
mind
so
i
must
later
find
myself
also
back
of
thoughts
q
to
wit
as
their
creator
and
owner
in
the
time
of
spirits
thoughts
grew
till
they
overtopped
my
head
whose
offspring
they
yet
were
they
hovered
about
me
and
convulsed
me
like
fever
phantasies
q
an
awful
power
the
thoughts
had
become
corporeal
on
their
own
account
were
ghosts
such
as
god
emperor
pope
fatherland
etc
if
i
destroy
their
corporeity
then
i
take
them
back
into
mine
and
say
i
alone
am
corporeal
and
now
i
take
the
world
as
what
it
is
to
me
as
mine
as
my
property
i
refer
all
to
myself
if
as
spirit
i
had
thrust
away
the
world
in
the
deepest
contempt
so
as
owner
i
thrust
spirits
or
ideas
away
into
their
vanity
they
have
no
longer
any
power
over
me
as
no
earthly
might
has
power
over
the
spirit
the
child
was
realistic
taken
up
with
the
things
of
this
world
till
little
by
little
he
succeeded
in
getting
at
what
was
back
of
these
very
things
the
youth
was
idealistic
inspired
by
thoughts
till
he
worked
his
way
up
to
where
he
became
the
man
the
egoistic
man
who
deals
with
things
and
thoughts
according
to
his
hearts
pleasure
and
sets
his
personal
interest
above
everything
finally
the
old
man
when
i
become
one
there
will
still
be
time
enough
to
speak
of
that

geist
this
word
will
be
translated
sometimes
mind
and
sometimes
spirit
in
the
following
pages
luke


ii
men
of
the
old
time
and
the
new
how
each
of
us
developed
himself
what
he
strove
for
attained
or
missed
what
objects
he
formerly
pursued
and
what
plans
and
wishes
his
heart
is
now
set
on
what
transformation
his
views
have
experienced
what
perturbations
his
principles
q
in
short
how
he
has
today
become
what
yesterday
or
years
ago
he
was
not
q
this
he
brings
out
again
from
his
memory
with
more
or
less
ease
and
he
feels
with
especial
vividness
what
changes
have
taken
place
in
himself
when
he
has
before
his
eyes
the
unrolling
of
anothers
life
let
us
therefore
look
into
the
activities
our
forefathers
busied
themselves
with
a
the
ancients
custom
having
once
given
the
name
of
the
ancients
to
our
pre
christian
ancestors
we
will
not
throw
it
up
against
them
that
in
comparison
with
us
experienced
people
they
ought
properly
to
be
called
children
but
will
rather
continue
to
honour
them
as
our
good
old
fathers
but
how
have
they
come
to
be
antiquated
and
who
could
displace
them
through
his
pretended
newness
we
know
of
course
the
revolutionary
innovator
and
disrespectful
heir
who
even
took
away
the
sanctity
of
the
fathers
sabbath
to
hallow
his
sunday
and
interrupted
the
course
of
time
to
begin
at
himself
with
a
new
chronology
we
know
him
and
know
that
it
is
q
the
christian
but
does
he
remain
forever
young
and
is
he
today
still
the
new
man
or
will
he
too
be
superseded
as
he
has
superseded
the
ancients
the
fathers
must
doubtless
have
themselves
begotten
the
young
one
who
entombed
them
let
us
then
peep
at
this
act
of
generation
to
the
ancients
the
world
was
a
truth
says
feuerbach

but
he
forgets
to
make
the
important
addition
a
truth
whose
untruth
they
tried
to
get
back
of
and
at
last
really
did
what
is
meant
by
those
words
of
feuerbach
will
be
easily
recognized
if
they
are
put
alongside
the
christian
thesis
of
the
vanity
and
transitoriness
of
the
world
for
as
the
christian
can
never
convince
himself
of
the
vanity
of
the
divine
word
but
believes
in
its
eternal
and
unshakable
truth
which
the
more
its
depths
are
searched
must
all
the
more
brilliantly
come
to
light
and
triumph
so
the
ancients
on
their
side
lived
in
the
feeling
that
the
world
and
mundane
relations
such
as
the
natural
ties
of
blood
were
the
truth
before
which
their
powerless
i
must
bow
the
very
thing
on
which
the
ancients
set
the
highest
value
is
spurned
by
christians
as
the
valueless
and
what
they
recognized
as
truth
these
brand
as
idle
lies
the
high
significance
of
the
fatherland
disappears
and
the
christian
must
regard
himself
as
a
stranger
on
earth

the
sanctity
of
funeral
rites
from
which
sprang
a
work
of
art
like
the
antigone
of
sophocles
is
designated
as
a
paltry
thing
let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
the
infrangible
truth
of
family
ties
is
represented
as
an
untruth
which
one
cannot
promptly
enough
get
clear
of

and
so
in
everything
if
we
now
see
that
to
the
two
sides
opposite
things
appear
as
truth
to
one
the
natural
to
the
other
the
intellectual
to
one
earthly
things
and
relations
to
the
other
heavenly
the
heavenly
fatherland
jerusalem
that
is
above
etc
it
still
remains
to
be
considered
how
the
new
time
and
that
undeniable
reversal
could
come
out
of
antiquity
but
the
ancients
themselves
worked
toward
making
their
truth
a
lie
let
us
plunge
at
once
into
the
midst
of
the
most
brilliant
years
of
the
ancients
into
the
periclean
century
then
the
sophistic
culture
was
spreading
and
greece
made
a
pastime
of
what
had
hitherto
been
to
her
a
monstrously
serious
matter
the
fathers
had
been
enslaved
by
the
undisturbed
power
of
existing
things
too
long
for
the
posterity
not
to
have
to
learn
by
bitter
experience
to
feel
themselves
therefore
the
sophists
with
courageous
sauciness
pronounce
the
reassuring
words
dont
be
bluffed
and
diffuse
the
rationalistic
doctrine
use
your
understanding
your
wit
your
mind
against
everything
it
is
by
having
a
good
and
well
drilled
understanding
that
one
gets
through
the
world
best
provides
for
himself
the
best
lot
the
pleasantest
life
thus
they
recognize
in
mind
mans
true
weapon
against
the
world
this
is
why
they
lay
such
stress
on
dialectic
skill
command
of
language
the
art
of
disputation
etc
they
announce
that
mind
is
to
be
used
against
everything
but
they
are
still
far
removed
from
the
holiness
of
the
spirit
for
to
them
it
is
a
means
a
weapon
as
trickery
and
defiance
serve
children
for
the
same
purpose
their
mind
is
the
unbribable
understanding
today
we
should
call
that
a
one
sided
culture
of
the
understanding
and
add
the
warning
cultivate
not
only
your
understanding
but
also
and
especially
your
heart
socrates
did
the
same
for
if
the
heart
did
not
become
free
from
its
natural
impulses
but
remained
filled
with
the
most
fortuitous
contents
and
as
an
uncriticized
avidity
altogether
in
the
power
of
things
nothing
but
a
vessel
of
the
most
various
appetites
q
then
it
was
unavoidable
that
the
free
understanding
must
serve
the
bad
heart
and
was
ready
to
justify
everything
that
the
wicked
heart
desired
therefore
socrates
says
that
it
is
not
enough
for
one
to
use
his
understanding
in
all
things
but
it
is
a
question
of
what
cause
one
exerts
it
for
we
should
now
say
one
must
serve
the
good
cause
but
serving
the
good
cause
is
q
being
moral
hence
socrates
is
the
founder
of
ethics
certainly
the
principle
of
the
sophistic
doctrine
must
lead
to
the
possibility
that
the
blindest
and
most
dependent
slave
of
his
desires
might
yet
be
an
excellent
sophist
and
with
keen
understanding
trim
and
expound
everything
in
favour
of
his
coarse
heart
what
could
there
be
for
which
a
good
reason
might
not
be
found
or
which
might
not
be
defended
through
thick
and
thin
therefore
socrates
says
you
must
be
pure
hearted
if
your
shrewdness
is
to
be
valued
at
this
point
begins
the
second
period
of
greek
liberation
of
the
mind
the
period
of
purity
of
heart
for
the
first
was
brought
to
a
close
by
the
sophists
in
their
proclaiming
the
omnipotence
of
the
understanding
but
the
heart
remained
worldly
minded
remained
a
servant
of
the
world
always
affected
by
worldly
wishes
this
coarse
heart
was
to
be
cultivated
from
now
on
q
the
era
of
culture
of
the
heart
but
how
is
the
heart
to
be
cultivated
what
the
understanding
this
one
side
of
the
mind
has
reached
q
to
wit
the
capability
of
playing
freely
with
and
over
every
concern
q
awaits
the
heart
also
everything
worldly
must
come
to
grief
before
it
so
that
at
last
family
commonwealth
fatherland
and
the
like
are
given
up
for
the
sake
of
the
heart
that
is
of
blessedness
the
hearts
blessedness
daily
experience
confirms
the
truth
that
the
understanding
may
have
renounced
a
thing
many
years
before
the
heart
has
ceased
to
beat
for
it
so
the
sophistic
understanding
too
had
so
far
become
master
over
the
dominant
ancient
powers
that
they
now
needed
only
to
be
driven
out
of
the
heart
in
which
they
dwelt
unmolested
to
have
at
last
no
part
at
all
left
in
man
this
war
is
opened
by
socrates
and
not
till
the
dying
day
of
the
old
world
does
it
end
in
peace
the
examination
of
the
heart
takes
its
start
with
socrates
and
all
the
contents
of
the
heart
are
sifted
in
their
last
and
extremest
struggles
the
ancients
threw
all
contents
out
of
the
heart
and
let
it
no
longer
beat
for
anything
this
was
the
deed
of
the
skeptics
the
same
purgation
of
the
heart
was
now
achieved
in
the
skeptical
age
as
the
understanding
had
succeeded
in
establishing
in
the
sophistic
age
the
sophistic
culture
has
brought
it
to
pass
that
ones
understanding
no
longer
stands
still
before
anything
and
the
skeptical
that
his
heart
is
no
longer
moved
by
anything
so
long
as
man
is
entangled
in
the
movements
of
the
world
and
embarrassed
by
relations
to
the
world
q
and
he
is
so
till
the
end
of
antiquity
because
his
heart
still
has
to
struggle
for
independence
from
the
worldly
q
so
long
he
is
not
yet
spirit
for
spirit
is
without
body
and
has
no
relations
to
the
world
and
corporeality
for
it
the
world
does
not
exist
nor
natural
bonds
but
only
the
spiritual
and
spiritual
bonds
therefore
man
must
first
become
so
completely
unconcerned
and
reckless
so
altogether
without
relations
as
the
skeptical
culture
presents
him
q
so
altogether
indifferent
to
the
world
that
even
its
falling
in
ruins
would
not
move
him
q
before
he
could
feel
himself
as
worldless
that
is
as
spirit
and
this
is
the
result
of
the
gigantic
work
of
the
ancients
that
man
knows
himself
as
a
being
without
relations
and
without
a
world
as
spirit
only
now
after
all
worldly
care
has
left
him
is
he
all
in
all
to
himself
is
he
only
for
himself
is
he
spirit
for
the
spirit
or
in
plainer
language
he
cares
only
for
the
spiritual
in
the
christian
wisdom
of
serpents
and
innocence
of
doves
the
two
sides
q
understanding
and
heart
q
of
the
ancient
liberation
of
mind
are
so
completed
that
they
appear
young
and
new
again
and
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
lets
itself
be
bluffed
any
longer
by
the
worldly
and
natural
thus
the
ancients
mounted
to
spirit
and
strove
to
become
spiritual
but
a
man
who
wishes
to
be
active
as
spirit
is
drawn
to
quite
other
tasks
than
he
was
able
to
set
himself
formerly
to
tasks
which
really
give
something
to
do
to
the
spirit
and
not
to
mere
sense
or
acuteness

which
exerts
itself
only
to
become
master
of
things
the
spirit
busies
itself
solely
about
the
spiritual
and
seeks
out
the
traces
of
mind
in
everything
to
the
believing
spirit
everything
comes
from
god
and
interests
him
only
to
the
extent
that
it
reveals
this
origin
to
the
philosophic
spirit
everything
appears
with
the
stamp
of
reason
and
interests
him
only
so
far
as
he
is
able
to
discover
in
it
reason
that
is
spiritual
content
not
the
spirit
then
which
has
to
do
with
absolutely
nothing
unspiritual
with
no
thing
but
only
with
the
essence
which
exists
behind
and
above
things
with
thoughts
q
not
that
did
the
ancients
exert
for
they
did
not
yet
have
it
no
they
had
only
reached
the
point
of
struggling
and
longing
for
it
and
therefore
sharpened
it
against
their
too
powerful
foe
the
world
of
sense
but
what
would
not
have
been
sensuous
for
them
since
jehovah
or
the
gods
of
the
heathen
were
yet
far
removed
from
the
conception
god
is
spirit
since
the
heavenly
fatherland
had
not
yet
stepped
into
the
place
of
the
sensuous
etc
q
they
sharpened
against
the
world
of
sense
their
sense
their
acuteness
to
this
day
the
jews
those
precocious
children
of
antiquity
have
got
no
farther
and
with
all
the
subtlety
and
strength
of
their
prudence
and
understanding
which
easily
becomes
master
of
things
and
forces
them
to
obey
it
they
cannot
discover
spirit
which
takes
no
account
whatever
of
things
the
christian
has
spiritual
interests
because
he
allows
himself
to
be
a
spiritual
man
the
jew
does
not
even
understand
these
interests
in
their
purity
because
he
does
not
allow
himself
to
assign
no
value
to
things
he
does
not
arrive
at
pure
spirituality
a
spirituality
such
as
is
religiously
expressed
for
instance
in
the
faith
of
christians
which
alone
without
works
justifies
their
unspirituality
sets
jews
forever
apart
from
christians
for
the
spiritual
man
is
incomprehensible
to
the
unspiritual
as
the
unspiritual
is
contemptible
to
the
spiritual
but
the
jews
have
only
the
spirit
of
this
world
the
ancient
acuteness
and
profundity
lies
as
far
from
the
spirit
and
the
spirituality
of
the
christian
world
as
earth
from
heaven
he
who
feels
himself
as
free
spirit
is
not
oppressed
and
made
anxious
by
the
things
of
this
world
because
he
does
not
care
for
them
if
one
is
still
to
feel
their
burden
he
must
be
narrow
enough
to
attach
weight
to
them
q
as
is
evidently
the
case
for
instance
when
one
is
still
concerned
for
his
dear
life
he
to
whom
everything
centres
in
knowing
and
conducting
himself
as
a
free
spirit
gives
little
heed
to
how
scantily
he
is
supplied
meanwhile
and
does
not
reflect
at
all
on
how
he
must
make
his
arrangements
to
have
a
thoroughly
free
or
enjoyable
life
he
is
not
disturbed
by
the
inconveniences
of
the
life
that
depends
on
things
because
he
lives
only
spiritually
and
on
spiritual
food
while
aside
from
this
he
only
gulps
things
down
like
a
beast
hardly
knowing
it
and
dies
bodily
to
be
sure
when
his
fodder
gives
out
but
knows
himself
immortal
as
spirit
and
closes
his
eyes
with
an
adoration
or
a
thought
his
life
is
occupation
with
the
spiritual
is
q
thinking
the
rest
does
not
bother
him
let
him
busy
himself
with
the
spiritual
in
any
way
that
he
can
and
chooses
q
in
devotion
in
contemplation
or
in
philosophic
cognition
q
his
doing
is
always
thinking
and
therefore
descartes
to
whom
this
had
at
last
become
quite
clear
could
lay
down
the
proposition
i
think
that
is
q
i
am
this
means
my
thinking
is
my
being
or
my
life
only
when
i
live
spiritually
do
i
live
only
as
spirit
am
i
really
or
q
i
am
spirit
through
and
through
and
nothing
but
spirit

the
portrait
of
this
man
become
a
spirit
for
the
spirits
body
is
shadowless
over
against
this
how
different
among
the
ancients
stoutly
and
manfully
as
they
might
bear
themselves
against
the
might
of
things
they
must
yet
acknowledge
the
might
itself
and
got
no
farther
than
to
protect
their
life
against
it
as
well
as
possible
only
at
a
late
hour
did
they
recognize
that
their
true
life
was
not
that
which
they
led
in
the
fight
against
the
things
of
the
world
but
the
spiritual
life
turned
away
from
these
things
and
when
they
saw
this
they
became
christians
the
moderns
and
innovators
upon
the
ancients
but
the
life
turned
away
from
things
the
spiritual
life
no
longer
draws
any
nourishment
from
nature
but
lives
only
on
thoughts
and
therefore
is
no
longer
life
but
q
thinking
yet
it
must
not
be
supposed
now
that
the
ancients
were
without
thoughts
just
as
the
most
spiritual
man
is
not
to
be
conceived
of
as
if
he
could
be
without
life
rather
they
had
their
thoughts
about
everything
about
the
world
man
the
gods
etc
and
showed
themselves
keenly
active
in
bringing
all
this
to
their
consciousness
but
they
did
not
know
thought
even
though
they
thought
of
all
sorts
of
things
and
worried
themselves
with
their
thoughts
compare
with
their
position
the
christian
saying
my
thoughts
are
not
your
thoughts
as
the
heaven
is
higher
than
the
earth
so
are
my
thoughts
higher
than
your
thoughts
and
remember
what
was
said
above
about
our
child
thoughts
what
is
antiquity
seeking
then
the
true
enjoyment
of
life
you
will
find
that
at
bottom
it
is
all
the
same
as
the
true
life
the
greek
poet
simonides
sings
health
is
the
noblest
good
for
mortal
man
the
next
to
this
is
beauty
the
third
riches
acquired
without
guile
the
fourth
the
enjoyment
of
social
pleasures
in
the
company
of
young
friends
these
are
all
good
things
of
life
pleasures
of
life
what
else
was
diogenes
of
sinope
seeking
for
than
the
true
enjoyment
of
life
which
he
discovered
in
having
the
least
possible
wants
what
else
aristippus

who
found
it
in
a
cheery
temper
under
all
circumstances
they
are
seeking
for
cheery
unclouded
life
courage
for
cheeriness
they
are
seeking
to
be
of
good
cheer
the
stoics
want
to
realize
the
wise
man
the
man
with
practical
philosophy
the
man
who
knows
how
to
live
q
a
wise
life
therefore
they
find
him
in
contempt
for
the
world
in
a
life
without
development
without
spreading
out
without
friendly
relations
with
the
world
thus
in
the
isolated
life
in
life
as
life
not
in
life
with
others
only
the
stoic
lives
all
else
is
dead
for
him
the
epicureans
on
the
contrary
demand
a
moving
life
the
ancients
as
they
want
to
be
of
good
cheer
desire
good
living
the
jews
especially
a
long
life
blessed
with
children
and
goods
eudaemonia
well
being
in
the
most
various
forms
democritus
for
example
praises
as
such
the
calm
of
the
soul
in
which
one
lives
smoothly
without
fear
and
without
excitement
so
what
he
thinks
is
that
with
this
he
gets
on
best
provides
for
himself
the
best
lot
and
gets
through
the
world
best
but
as
he
cannot
get
rid
of
the
world
q
and
in
fact
cannot
for
the
very
reason
that
his
whole
activity
is
taken
up
in
the
effort
to
get
rid
of
it
that
is
in
repelling
the
world
for
which
it
is
yet
necessary
that
what
can
be
and
is
repelled
should
remain
existing
otherwise
there
would
be
no
longer
anything
to
repel
q
he
reaches
at
most
an
extreme
degree
of
liberation
and
is
distinguishable
only
in
degree
from
the
less
liberated
if
he
even
got
as
far
as
the
deadening
of
the
earthly
sense
which
at
last
admits
only
the
monotonous
whisper
of
the
word
brahm

he
nevertheless
would
not
be
essentially
distinguishable
from
the
sensual
man
even
the
stoic
attitude
and
manly
virtue
amounts
only
to
this
q
that
one
must
maintain
and
assert
himself
against
the
world
and
the
ethics
of
the
stoics
their
only
science
since
they
could
tell
nothing
about
the
spirit
but
how
it
should
behave
toward
the
world
and
of
nature
physics
only
this
that
the
wise
man
must
assert
himself
against
it
is
not
a
doctrine
of
the
spirit
but
only
a
doctrine
of
the
repelling
of
the
world
and
of
self
assertion
against
the
world
and
this
consists
in
imperturbability
and
equanimity
of
life
and
so
in
the
most
explicit
roman
virtue
the
romans
too
horace
cicero
and
others
went
no
further
than
this
practical
philosophy
the
comfort
hedone
of
the
epicureans
is
the
same
practical
philosophy
the
stoics
teach
only
trickier
more
deceitful
they
teach
only
another
behaviour
toward
the
world
exhort
us
only
to
take
a
shrewd
attitude
toward
the
world
the
world
must
be
deceived
for
it
is
my
enemy
the
break
with
the
world
is
completely
carried
through
by
the
skeptics
my
entire
relation
to
the
world
is
worthless
and
truthless
timon
says
the
feelings
and
thoughts
which
we
draw
from
the
world
contain
no
truth
what
is
truth
cries
pilate
according
to
pyrrhos
doctrine
the
world
is
neither
good
nor
bad
neither
beautiful
nor
ugly
but
these
are
predicates
which
i
give
it
timon
says
that
in
itself
nothing
is
either
good
or
bad
but
man
only
thinks
of
it
thus
or
thus
to
face
the
world
only
ataraxia
unmovedness
and
aphasia
speechlessness
q
or
in
other
words
isolated
inwardness
are
left
there
is
no
longer
any
truth
to
be
recognized
in
the
world
things
contradict
themselves
thoughts
about
things
are
without
distinction
good
and
bad
are
all
the
same
so
that
what
one
calls
good
another
finds
bad
here
the
recognition
of
truth
is
at
an
end
and
only
the
man
without
power
of
recognition
the
man
who
finds
in
the
world
nothing
to
recognize
is
left
and
this
man
just
leaves
the
truth
vacant
world
where
it
is
and
takes
no
account
of
it
so
antiquity
gets
through
with
the
world
of
things
the
order
of
the
world
the
world
as
a
whole
but
to
the
order
of
the
world
or
the
things
of
this
world
belong
not
only
nature
but
all
relations
in
which
man
sees
himself
placed
by
nature
as
in
the
family
the
community
q
in
short
the
so
called
natural
bonds
with
the
world
of
the
spirit
christianity
then
begins
the
man
who
still
faces
the
world
armed
is
the
ancient
the
q
heathen
to
which
class
the
jew
too
as
non
christian
belongs
the
man
who
has
come
to
be
led
by
nothing
but
his
hearts
pleasure
the
interest
he
takes
his
fellow
feeling
his
q
spirit
is
the
modern
the
q
christian
as
the
ancients
worked
toward
the
conquest
of
the
world
and
strove
to
release
man
from
the
heavy
trammels
of
connection
with
other
things
at
last
they
came
also
to
the
dissolution
of
the
state
and
giving
preference
to
everything
private
of
course
community
family
and
so
forth
as
natural
relations
are
burdensome
hindrances
which
diminish
my
spiritual
freedom
b
the
moderns
if
any
man
be
in
christ
he
is
a
new
creature
the
old
is
passed
away
behold
all
is
become
new

as
it
was
said
above
to
the
ancients
the
world
was
a
truth
we
must
say
here
to
the
moderns
the
spirit
was
a
truth
but
here
as
there
we
must
not
omit
the
supplement
a
truth
whose
untruth
they
tried
to
get
back
of
and
at
last
they
really
do
a
course
similar
to
that
which
antiquity
took
may
be
demonstrated
in
christianity
also
in
that
the
understanding
was
held
a
prisoner
under
the
dominion
of
the
christian
dogmas
up
to
the
time
preparatory
to
the
reformati
on
but
in
the
pre
reformation
century
asserted
itself
sophistically
and
played
heretical
pranks
with
all
tenets
of
the
faith
and
the
talk
then
was
especially
in
italy
and
at
the
roman
court
if
only
the
heart
remains
christian
minded
the
understanding
may
go
right
on
taking
its
pleasure
long
before
the
reformation
people
were
so
thoroughly
accustomed
to
fine
spun
wranglings
that
the
pope
and
most
others
looked
on
luthers
appearance
too
as
a
mere
wrangling
of
monks
at
first
humanism
corresponds
to
sophisticism
and
as
in
the
time
of
the
sophists
greek
life
stood
in
its
fullest
bloom
the
periclean
age
so
the
most
brilliant
things
happened
in
the
time
of
humanism
or
as
one
might
perhaps
also
say
of
machiavellianism
printing
the
new
world
etc
at
this
time
the
heart
was
still
far
from
wanting
to
relieve
itself
of
its
christian
contents
but
finally
the
reformation
like
socrates
took
hold
seriously
of
the
heart
itself
and
since
then
hearts
have
kept
growing
visibly
q
more
unchristian
as
with
luther
people
began
to
take
the
matter
to
heart
the
outcome
of
this
step
of
the
reformation
must
be
that
the
heart
also
gets
lightened
of
the
heavy
burden
of
christian
faith
the
heart
from
day
to
day
more
unchristian
loses
the
contents
with
which
it
had
busied
itself
till
at
last
nothing
but
empty
warmheartedness
is
left
it
the
quite
general
love
of
men
the
love
of
man
the
consciousness
of
freedom
self
consciousness
only
so
is
christianity
complete
because
it
has
become
bald
withered
and
void
of
contents
there
are
now
no
contents
whatever
against
which
the
heart
does
not
mutiny
unless
indeed
the
heart
unconsciously
or
without
self
consciousness
lets
them
slip
in
the
heart
criticizes
to
death
with
hard
hearted
mercilessness
everything
that
wants
to
make
its
way
in
and
is
capable
except
as
before
unconsciously
or
taken
by
surprise
of
no
friendship
no
love
what
could
there
be
in
men
to
love
since
they
are
all
alike
egoists
none
of
them
man
as
such
none
are
spirit
only
the
christian
loves
only
the
spirit
but
where
could
one
be
found
who
should
be
really
nothing
but
spirit
to
have
a
liking
for
the
corporeal
man
with
hide
and
hair
q
why
that
would
no
longer
be
a
spiritual
warmheartedness
it
would
be
treason
against
pure
warmheartedness
the
theoretical
regard
for
pure
warmheartedness
is
by
no
means
to
be
conceived
as
like
that
kindliness
that
gives
everybody
a
friendly
hand
shake
on
the
contrary
pure
warmheartedness
is
warm
hearted
toward
nobody
it
is
only
a
theoretical
interest
concern
for
man
as
man
not
as
a
person
the
person
is
repulsive
to
it
because
of
being
egoistic
because
of
not
being
that
abstraction
man
but
it
is
only
for
the
abstraction
that
one
can
have
a
theoretical
regard
to
pure
warmheartedness
or
pure
theory
men
exist
only
to
be
criticized
scoffed
at
and
thoroughly
despised
to
it
no
less
than
to
the
fanatical
parson
they
are
only
filth
and
other
such
nice
things
pushed
to
this
extremity
of
disinterested
warmheartedness
we
must
finally
become
conscious
that
the
spirit
which
alone
the
christian
loves
is
nothing
in
other
words
that
the
spirit
is
q
a
lie
what
has
here
been
set
down
roughly
summarily
and
doubtless
as
yet
incomprehensibly
will
it
is
to
be
hoped
become
clear
as
we
go
on
let
us
take
up
the
inheritance
left
by
the
ancients
and
as
active
workmen
do
with
it
as
much
as
q
can
be
done
with
it
the
world
lies
despised
at
our
feet
far
beneath
us
and
our
heaven
into
which
its
mighty
arms
are
no
longer
thrust
and
its
stupefying
breath
does
not
come
seductively
as
it
may
pose
it
can
delude
nothing
but
our
sense
it
cannot
lead
astray
the
spirit
q
and
spirit
alone
after
all
we
really
are
having
once
got
back
of
things
the
spirit
has
also
got
above
them
and
become
free
from
their
bonds
emancipated
supernal
free
so
speaks
spiritual
freedom
to
the
spirit
which
after
long
toil
has
got
rid
of
the
world
the
worldless
spirit
nothing
is
left
after
the
loss
of
the
world
and
the
worldly
but
q
the
spirit
and
the
spiritual
yet
as
it
has
only
moved
away
from
the
world
and
made
of
itself
a
being
free
from
the
world
without
being
able
really
to
annihilate
the
world
this
remains
to
it
a
stumbling
block
that
cannot
be
cleared
away
a
discredited
existence
and
as
on
the
other
hand
it
knows
and
recognizes
nothing
but
the
spirit
and
the
spiritual
it
must
perpetually
carry
about
with
it
the
longing
to
spiritualize
the
world
to
redeem
it
from
the
black
list
therefore
like
a
youth
it
goes
about
with
plans
for
the
redemption
or
improvement
of
the
world
the
ancients
we
saw
served
the
natural
the
worldly
the
natural
order
of
the
world
but
they
incessantly
asked
themselves
of
this
service
and
when
they
had
tired
themselves
to
death
in
ever
renewed
attempts
at
revolt
then
among
their
last
sighs
was
born
to
them
the
god
the
conqueror
of
the
world
all
their
doing
had
been
nothing
but
wisdom
of
the
world
an
effort
to
get
back
of
the
world
and
above
it
and
what
is
the
wisdom
of
the
many
following
centuries
what
did
the
moderns
try
to
get
back
of
no
longer
to
get
back
of
the
world
for
the
ancients
had
accomplished
that
but
back
of
the
god
whom
the
ancients
bequeathed
to
them
back
of
the
god
who
is
spirit
back
of
everything
that
is
the
spirits
the
spiritual
but
the
activity
of
the
spirit
which
searches
even
the
depths
of
the
godhead
is
theology
if
the
ancients
have
nothing
to
show
but
wisdom
of
the
world
the
moderns
never
did
nor
do
make
their
way
further
than
to
theology
we
shall
see
later
that
even
the
newest
revolts
against
god
are
nothing
but
the
extremest
efforts
of
theology
that
is
theological
insurrections

the
spirit
the
realm
of
spirits
is
monstrously
great
there
is
an
infinite
deal
of
the
spiritual
yet
let
us
look
and
see
what
the
spirit
this
bequest
of
the
ancients
properly
is
out
of
their
birth
pangs
it
came
forth
but
they
themselves
could
not
utter
themselves
as
spirit
they
could
give
birth
to
it
it
itself
must
speak
the
born
god
the
son
of
man
is
the
first
to
utter
the
word
that
the
spirit
he
god
has
to
do
with
nothing
earthly
and
no
earthly
relationship
but
solely
with
the
spirit
and
spiritual
relationships
is
my
courage
indestructible
under
all
the
worlds
blows
my
inflexibility
and
my
obduracy
perchance
already
spirit
in
the
full
sense
because
the
world
cannot
touch
it
why
then
it
would
not
yet
be
at
enmity
with
the
world
and
all
its
action
would
consist
merely
in
not
succumbing
to
the
world
no
so
long
as
it
does
not
busy
itself
with
itself
alone
so
long
as
it
does
not
have
to
do
with
its
world
the
spiritual
alone
it
is
not
free
spirit
but
only
the
spirit
of
this
world
the
spirit
fettered
to
it
the
spirit
is
free
spirit
that
is
really
spirit
only
in
a
world
of
its
own
in
this
the
earthly
world
it
is
a
stranger
only
through
a
spiritual
world
is
the
spirit
really
spirit
for
this
world
does
not
understand
it
and
does
not
know
how
to
keep
the
maiden
from
a
foreign
land
from
departing
but
where
is
it
to
get
this
spiritual
world
where
but
out
of
itself
it
must
reveal
itself
and
the
words
that
it
speaks
the
revelations
in
which
it
unveils
itself
these
are
its
world
as
a
visionary
lives
and
has
his
world
only
in
the
visionary
pictures
that
he
himself
creates
as
a
crazy
man
generates
for
himself
his
own
dream
world
without
which
he
could
not
be
crazy
so
the
spirit
must
create
for
itself
its
spirit
world
and
is
not
spirit
till
it
creates
it
thus
its
creations
make
it
spirit
and
by
its
creatures
we
know
it
the
creator
in
them
it
lives
they
are
its
world
now
what
is
the
spirit
it
is
the
creator
of
a
spiritual
world
even
in
you
and
me
people
do
not
recognize
spirit
till
they
see
that
we
have
appropriated
to
ourselves
something
spiritual
though
thoughts
may
have
been
set
before
us
we
have
at
least
brought
them
to
live
in
ourselves
for
as
long
as
we
were
children
the
most
edifying
thoughts
might
have
been
laid
before
us
without
our
wishing
or
being
able
to
reproduce
them
in
ourselves
so
the
spirit
also
exists
only
when
it
creates
something
spiritual
it
is
real
only
together
with
the
spiritual
its
creature
as
then
we
know
it
by
its
works
the
question
is
what
these
works
are
but
the
works
or
children
of
the
spirit
are
nothing
else
but
q
spirits
if
i
had
before
me
jews
jews
of
the
true
metal
i
should
have
to
stop
here
and
leave
them
standing
before
this
mystery
as
for
almost
two
thousand
years
they
have
remained
standing
before
it
unbelieving
and
without
knowledge
but
as
you
my
dear
reader
are
at
least
not
a
full
blooded
jew
q
for
such
a
one
will
not
go
astray
as
far
as
this
q
we
will
still
go
along
a
bit
of
road
together
till
perhaps
you
too
turn
your
back
on
me
because
i
laugh
in
your
face
if
somebody
told
you
you
were
altogether
spirit
you
would
take
hold
of
your
body
and
not
believe
him
but
answer
i
have
a
spirit
no
doubt
but
do
not
exist
only
as
spirit
but
as
a
man
with
a
body
you
would
still
distinguish
yourself
from
your
spirit
but
replies
he
it
is
your
destiny
even
though
now
you
are
yet
going
about
in
the
fetters
of
the
body
to
be
one
day
a
blessed
spirit

and
however
you
may
conceive
of
the
future
aspect
of
your
spirit
so
much
is
yet
certain
that
in
death
you
will
put
off
this
body
and
yet
keep
yourself
your
spirit
for
all
eternity
accordingly
your
spirit
is
the
eternal
and
true
in
you
the
body
only
a
dwelling
here
below
which
you
may
leave
and
perhaps
exchange
for
another
now
you
believe
him
for
the
present
indeed
you
are
not
spirit
only
but
when
you
emigrate
from
the
mortal
body
as
one
day
you
must
then
you
will
have
to
help
yourself
without
the
body
and
therefore
it
is
needful
that
you
be
prudent
and
care
in
time
for
your
proper
self
what
should
it
profit
a
man
if
he
gained
the
whole
world
and
yet
suffered
damage
in
his
soul
but
even
granted
that
doubts
raised
in
the
course
of
time
against
the
tenets
of
the
christian
faith
have
long
since
robbed
you
of
faith
in
the
immortality
of
your
spirit
you
have
nevertheless
left
one
tenet
undisturbed
and
still
ingenuously
adhere
to
the
one
truth
that
the
spirit
is
your
better
part
and
that
the
spiritual
has
greater
claims
on
you
than
anything
else
despite
all
your
atheism
in
zeal
against
egoism
you
concur
with
the
believers
in
immortality
but
whom
do
you
think
of
under
the
name
of
egoist
a
man
who
instead
of
living
to
an
idea
that
is
a
spiritual
thing
and
sacrificing
to
it
his
personal
advantage
serves
the
latter
a
good
patriot
brings
his
sacrifice
to
the
altar
of
the
fatherland
but
it
cannot
be
disputed
that
the
fatherland
is
an
idea
since
for
beasts
incapable
of
mind

or
children
as
yet
without
mind
there
is
no
fatherland
and
no
patriotism
now
if
any
one
does
not
approve
himself
as
a
good
patriot
he
betrays
his
egoism
with
reference
to
the
fatherland
and
so
the
matter
stands
in
innumerable
other
cases
he
who
in
human
society
takes
the
benefit
of
a
prerogative
sins
egoistically
against
the
idea
of
equality
he
who
exercises
dominion
is
blamed
as
an
egoist
against
the
idea
of
liberty
and
so
on
you
despise
the
egoist
because
he
puts
the
spiritual
in
the
background
as
compared
with
the
personal
and
has
his
eyes
on
himself
where
you
would
like
to
see
him
act
to
favour
an
idea
the
distinction
between
you
is
that
he
makes
himself
the
central
point
but
you
the
spirit
or
that
you
cut
your
identity
in
two
and
exalt
your
proper
self
the
spirit
to
be
ruler
of
the
paltrier
remainder
while
he
will
hear
nothing
of
this
cutting
in
two
and
pursues
spiritual
and
material
interests
just
as
he
pleases
you
think
to
be
sure
that
you
are
falling
foul
of
those
only
who
enter
into
no
spiritual
interest
at
all
but
in
fact
you
curse
at
everybody
who
does
not
look
on
the
spiritual
interest
as
his
true
and
highest
interest
you
carry
your
knightly
service
for
this
beauty
so
far
that
you
affirm
her
to
be
the
only
beauty
of
the
world
you
live
not
to
yourself
but
to
your
spirit
and
to
what
is
the
spirits
that
is
ideas
as
the
spirit
exists
only
in
its
creating
of
the
spiritual
let
us
take
a
look
about
us
for
its
first
creation
if
only
it
has
accomplished
this
there
follows
thenceforth
a
natural
propagation
of
creations
as
according
to
the
myth
only
the
first
human
beings
needed
to
be
created
the
rest
of
the
race
propagating
of
itself
the
first
creation
on
the
other
hand
must
come
forth
out
of
nothing
q
the
spirit
has
toward
its
realization
nothing
but
itself
or
rather
it
has
not
yet
even
itself
but
must
create
itself
hence
its
first
creation
is
itself
the
spirit
mystical
as
this
sounds
we
yet
go
through
it
as
an
every
day
experience
are
you
a
thinking
being
before
you
think
in
creating
the
first
thought
you
create
yourself
the
thinking
one
for
you
do
not
think
before
you
think
a
thought
or
have
a
thought
is
it
not
your
singing
that
first
makes
you
a
singer
your
talking
that
makes
you
a
talker
now
so
too
it
is
the
production
of
the
spiritual
that
first
makes
you
a
spirit
meantime
as
you
distinguish
yourself
from
the
thinker
singer
and
talker
so
you
no
less
distinguish
yourself
from
the
spirit
and
feel
very
clearly
that
you
are
something
beside
spirit
but
as
in
the
thinking
ego
hearing
and
sight
easily
vanish
in
the
enthusiasm
of
thought
so
you
also
have
been
seized
by
the
spirit
enthusiasm
and
you
now
long
with
all
your
might
to
become
wholly
spirit
and
to
be
dissolved
in
spirit
the
spirit
is
your
ideal
the
unattained
the
other
worldly
spirit
is
the
name
of
your
q
god
god
is
spirit
against
all
that
is
not
spirit
you
are
a
zealot
and
therefore
you
play
the
zealot
against
yourself
who
cannot
get
rid
of
a
remainder
of
the
non
spiritual
instead
of
saying
i
am
more
than
spirit
you
say
with
contrition
i
am
less
than
spirit
and
spirit
pure
spirit
or
the
spirit
that
is
nothing
but
spirit
i
can
only
think
of
but
am
not
and
since
i
am
not
it
it
is
another
exists
as
another
whom
i
call
god
it
lies
in
the
nature
of
the
case
that
the
spirit
that
is
to
exist
as
pure
spirit
must
be
an
otherworldly
one
for
since
i
am
not
it
it
follows
that
it
can
only
be
outside
me
since
in
any
case
a
human
being
is
not
fully
comprehended
in
the
concept
spirit
it
follows
that
the
pure
spirit
the
spirit
as
such
can
only
be
outside
of
men
beyond
the
human
world
q
not
earthly
but
heavenly
only
from
this
disunion
in
which
i
and
the
spirit
lie
only
because
i
and
spirit
are
not
names
for
one
and
the
same
thing
but
different
names
for
completely
different
things
only
because
i
am
not
spirit
and
spirit
not
i
q
only
from
this
do
we
get
a
quite
tautological
explanation
of
the
necessity
that
the
spirit
dwells
in
the
other
world
that
is
is
god
but
from
this
it
also
appears
how
thoroughly
theological
is
the
liberation
that
feuerbach
is
labouring
to
give
us
what
he
says
is
that
we
had
only
mistaken
our
own
essence
and
therefore
looked
for
it
in
the
other
world
but
that
now
when
we
see
that
god
was
only
our
human
essence
we
must
recognize
it
again
as
ours
and
move
it
back
out
of
the
other
world
into
this
to
god
who
is
spirit
feuerbach
gives
the
name
our
essence
can
we
put
up
with
this
that
our
essence
is
brought
into
opposition
to
us
q
that
we
are
split
into
an
essential
and
an
unessential
self
do
we
not
therewith
go
back
into
the
dreary
misery
of
seeing
ourselves
banished
out
of
ourselves
what
have
we
gained
then
when
for
a
variation
we
have
transferred
into
ourselves
the
divine
outside
us
are
we
that
which
is
in
us
as
little
as
we
are
that
which
is
outside
us
i
am
as
little
my
heart
as
i
am
my
sweetheart
this
other
self
of
mine
just
because
we
are
not
the
spirit
that
dwells
in
us
just
for
that
reason
we
had
to
take
it
and
set
it
outside
us
it
was
not
we
did
not
coincide
with
us
and
therefore
we
could
not
think
of
it
as
existing
otherwise
than
outside
us
on
the
other
side
from
us
in
the
other
world
with
the
strength
of
despair
feuerbach
clutches
at
the
total
substance
of
christianity
not
to
throw
it
away
no
to
drag
it
to
himself
to
draw
it
the
long
yearned
for
ever
distant
out
of
its
heaven
with
a
last
effort
and
keep
it
by
him
forever
is
not
that
a
clutch
of
the
uttermost
despair
a
clutch
for
life
or
death
and
is
it
not
at
the
same
time
the
christian
yearning
and
hungering
for
the
other
world
the
hero
wants
not
to
go
into
the
other
world
but
to
draw
the
other
world
to
him
and
compel
it
to
become
this
world
and
since
then
has
not
all
the
world
with
more
or
less
consciousness
been
crying
that
this
world
is
the
vital
point
and
heaven
must
come
down
on
earth
and
be
experienced
even
here
let
us
in
brief
set
feuerbachs
theological
view
and
our
contradiction
over
against
each
other
the
essence
of
man
is
mans
supreme
being

now
by
religion
to
be
sure
the
supreme
being
is
called
god
and
regarded
as
an
objective
essence
but
in
truth
it
is
only
mans
own
essence
and
therefore
the
turning
point
of
the
worlds
history
is
that
henceforth
no
longer
god
but
man
is
to
appear
to
man
as
god

to
this
we
reply
the
supreme
being
is
indeed
the
essence
of
man
but
just
because
it
is
his
essence
and
not
he
himself
it
remains
quite
immaterial
whether
we
see
it
outside
him
and
view
it
as
god
or
find
it
in
him
and
call
it
essence
of
man
or
man
i
am
neither
god
nor
man

neither
the
supreme
essence
nor
my
essence
and
therefore
it
is
all
one
in
the
main
whether
i
think
of
the
essence
as
in
me
or
outside
me
nay
we
really
do
always
think
of
the
supreme
being
as
in
both
kinds
of
otherworldliness
the
inward
and
outward
at
once
for
the
spirit
of
god
is
according
to
the
christian
view
also
our
spirit
and
dwells
in
us

it
dwells
in
heaven
and
dwells
in
us
we
poor
things
are
just
its
dwelling
and
if
feuerbach
goes
on
to
destroy
its
heavenly
dwelling
and
force
it
to
move
to
us
bag
and
baggage
then
we
its
earthly
apartments
will
be
badly
overcrowded
but
after
this
digression
which
if
we
were
at
all
proposing
to
work
by
line
and
level
we
should
have
had
to
save
for
later
pages
in
order
to
avoid
repetition
we
return
to
the
spirits
first
creation
the
spirit
itself
the
spirit
is
something
other
than
myself
but
this
other
what
is
it

the
possessed
have
you
ever
seen
a
spirit
no
not
i
but
my
grandmother
now
you
see
its
just
so
with
me
too
i
myself
havent
seen
any
but
my
grandmother
had
them
running
between
her
feet
all
sorts
of
ways
and
out
of
confidence
in
our
grandmothers
honesty
we
believe
in
the
existence
of
spirits
but
had
we
no
grandfathers
then
and
did
they
not
shrug
their
shoulders
every
time
our
grandmothers
told
about
their
ghosts
yes
those
were
unbelieving
men
who
have
harmed
our
good
religion
much
those
rationalists
we
shall
feel
that
what
else
lies
at
the
bottom
of
this
warm
faith
in
ghosts
if
not
the
faith
in
the
existence
of
spiritual
beings
in
general
and
is
not
this
latter
itself
disastrously
unsettled
if
saucy
men
of
the
understanding
may
disturb
the
former
the
romanticists
were
quite
conscious
what
a
blow
the
very
belief
in
god
suffered
by
the
laying
aside
of
the
belief
in
spirits
or
ghosts
and
they
tried
to
help
us
out
of
the
baleful
consequences
not
only
by
their
reawakened
fairy
world
but
at
last
and
especially
by
the
intrusion
of
a
higher
world
by
their
somnambulists
of
prevorst

etc
the
good
believers
and
fathers
of
the
church
did
not
suspect
that
with
the
belief
in
ghosts
the
foundation
of
religion
was
withdrawn
and
that
since
then
it
had
been
floating
in
the
air
he
who
no
longer
believes
in
any
ghost
needs
only
to
travel
on
consistently
in
his
unbelief
to
see
that
there
is
no
separate
being
at
all
concealed
behind
things
no
ghost
or
q
what
is
naively
reckoned
as
synonymous
even
in
our
use
of
words
q
no
spirit
spirits
exist
look
about
in
the
world
and
say
for
yourself
whether
a
spirit
does
not
gaze
upon
you
out
of
everything
out
of
the
lovely
little
flower
there
speaks
to
you
the
spirit
of
the
creator
who
has
shaped
it
so
wonderfully
the
stars
proclaim
the
spirit
that
established
their
order
from
the
mountain
tops
a
spirit
of
sublimity
breathes
down
out
of
the
waters
a
spirit
of
yearning
murmurs
up
and
q
out
of
men
millions
of
spirits
speak
the
mountains
may
sink
the
flowers
fade
the
world
of
stars
fall
in
ruins
the
men
die
q
what
matters
the
wreck
of
these
visible
bodies
the
spirit
the
invisible
spirit
abides
eternally
yes
the
whole
world
is
haunted
only
is
haunted
nay
it
itself
walks
it
is
uncanny
through
and
through
it
is
the
wandering
seeming
body
of
a
spirit
it
is
a
spook
what
else
should
a
ghost
be
then
than
an
apparent
body
but
real
spirit
well
the
world
is
empty
is
naught
is
only
glamorous
semblance
its
truth
is
the
spirit
alone
it
is
the
seeming
body
of
a
spirit
look
out
near
or
far
a
ghostly
world
surrounds
you
everywhere
you
are
always
having
apparitions
or
visions
everything
that
appears
to
you
is
only
the
phantasm
of
an
indwelling
spirit
is
a
ghostly
apparition
the
world
is
to
you
only
a
world
of
appearances
behind
which
the
spirit
walks
you
see
spirits
are
you
perchance
thinking
of
comparing
yourself
with
the
ancients
who
saw
gods
everywhere
gods
my
dear
modern
are
not
spirits
gods
do
not
degrade
the
world
to
a
semblance
and
do
not
spiritualize
it
but
to
you
the
whole
world
is
spiritualized
and
has
become
an
enigmatical
ghost
therefore
do
not
wonder
if
you
likewise
find
in
yourself
nothing
but
a
spook
is
not
your
body
haunted
by
your
spirit
and
is
not
the
latter
alone
the
true
and
real
the
former
only
the
transitory
naught
or
a
semblance
are
we
not
all
ghosts
uncanny
beings
that
wait
for
deliverance
q
to
wit
spirits
since
the
spirit
appeared
in
the
world
since
the
word
became
flesh
since
then
the
world
has
been
spiritualized
enchanted
a
spook
you
have
spirit
for
you
have
thoughts
what
are
your
thoughts
spiritual
entities
not
things
then
no
but
the
spirit
of
things
the
main
point
in
all
things
the
inmost
in
them
their
q
idea
consequently
what
you
think
is
not
only
your
thought
on
the
contrary
it
is
that
in
the
world
which
is
most
real
that
which
is
properly
to
be
called
true
it
is
the
truth
itself
if
i
only
think
truly
i
think
the
truth
i
may
to
be
sure
err
with
regard
to
the
truth
and
fail
to
recognize
it
but
if
i
recognize
truly
the
object
of
my
cognition
is
the
truth
so
i
suppose
you
strive
at
all
times
to
recognize
the
truth
to
me
the
truth
is
sacred
it
may
well
happen
that
i
find
a
truth
incomplete
and
replace
it
with
a
better
but
the
truth
i
cannot
abrogate
i
believe
in
the
truth
therefore
i
search
in
it
nothing
transcends
it
it
is
eternal
sacred
eternal
is
the
truth
it
is
the
sacred
the
eternal
but
you
who
let
yourself
be
filled
and
led
by
this
sacred
thing
are
yourself
hallowed
further
the
sacred
is
not
for
your
senses
q
and
you
never
as
a
sensual
man
discover
its
trace
q
but
for
your
faith
or
more
definitely
still
for
your
spirit
for
it
itself
you
know
is
a
spiritual
thing
a
spirit
q
is
spirit
for
the
spirit
the
sacred
is
by
no
means
so
easily
to
be
set
aside
as
many
at
present
affirm
who
no
longer
take
this
unsuitable
word
into
their
mouths
if
even
in
a
single
respect
i
am
still
upbraided
as
an
egoist
there
is
left
the
thought
of
something
else
which
i
should
serve
more
than
myself
and
which
must
be
to
me
more
important
than
everything
in
short
somewhat
in
which
i
should
have
to
seek
my
true
welfare

something
q
sacred

however
human
this
sacred
thing
may
look
though
it
be
the
human
itself
that
does
not
take
away
its
sacredness
but
at
most
changes
it
from
an
unearthly
to
an
earthly
sacred
thing
from
a
divine
one
to
a
human
sacred
things
exist
only
for
the
egoist
who
does
not
acknowledge
himself
the
involuntary
egoist
for
him
who
is
always
looking
after
his
own
and
yet
does
not
count
himself
as
the
highest
being
who
serves
only
himself
and
at
the
same
time
always
thinks
he
is
serving
a
higher
being
who
knows
nothing
higher
than
himself
and
yet
is
infatuated
about
something
higher
in
short
for
the
egoist
who
would
like
not
to
be
an
egoist
and
abases
himself
combats
his
egoism
but
at
the
same
time
abases
himself
only
for
the
sake
of
being
exalted
and
therefore
of
gratifying
his
egoism
because
he
would
like
to
cease
to
be
an
egoist
he
looks
about
in
heaven
and
earth
for
higher
beings
to
serve
and
sacrifice
himself
to
but
however
much
he
shakes
and
disciplines
himself
in
the
end
he
does
all
for
his
own
sake
and
the
disreputable
egoism
will
not
come
off
him
on
this
account
i
call
him
the
involuntary
egoist
his
toil
and
care
to
get
away
from
himself
is
nothing
but
the
misunderstood
impulse
to
self
dissolution
if
you
are
bound
to
your
past
hour
if
you
must
babble
today
because
you
babbled
yesterday

if
you
cannot
transform
yourself
each
instant
you
feel
yourself
fettered
to
slavery
and
benumbed
therefore
over
each
minute
of
your
existence
a
fresh
minute
of
the
future
beckons
to
you
and
developing
yourself
you
get
away
from
yourself
that
is
from
the
self
that
was
at
that
moment
as
you
are
at
each
instant
you
are
your
own
creature
and
in
this
very
creature
you
do
not
wish
to
lose
yourself
the
creator
you
are
yourself
a
higher
being
than
you
are
and
surpass
yourself
but
that
you
are
the
one
who
is
higher
than
you
that
is
that
you
are
not
only
creature
but
likewise
your
creator
q
just
this
as
an
involuntary
egoist
you
fail
to
recognize
and
therefore
the
higher
essence
is
to
you
q
an
alien
essence
every
higher
essence
such
as
truth
mankind
and
so
on
is
an
essence
over
us
alienness
is
a
criterion
of
the
sacred
in
everything
sacred
there
lies
something
uncanny
strange

such
as
we
are
not
quite
familiar
and
at
home
in
what
is
sacred
to
me
is
not
my
own
and
if
for
instance
the
property
of
others
was
not
sacred
to
me
i
should
look
on
it
as
mine
which
i
should
take
to
myself
when
occasion
offered
or
on
the
other
side
if
i
regard
the
face
of
the
chinese
emperor
as
sacred
it
remains
strange
to
my
eye
which
i
close
at
its
appearance
why
is
an
incontrovertible
mathematical
truth
which
might
even
be
called
eternal
according
to
the
common
understanding
of
words
not
q
sacred
because
it
is
not
revealed
or
not
the
revelation
of
a
higher
being
if
by
revealed
we
understand
only
the
so
called
religious
truths
we
go
far
astray
and
entirely
fail
to
recognize
the
breadth
of
the
concept
higher
being
atheists
keep
up
their
scoffing
at
the
higher
being
which
was
also
honoured
under
the
name
of
the
highest
or
tre
suprme
and
trample
in
the
dust
one
proof
of
his
existence
after
another
without
noticing
that
they
themselves
out
of
need
for
a
higher
being
only
annihilate
the
old
to
make
room
for
a
new
is
man
perchance
not
a
higher
essence
than
an
individual
man
and
must
not
the
truths
rights
and
ideas
which
result
from
the
concept
of
him
be
honoured
and
q
counted
sacred
as
revelations
of
this
very
concept
for
even
though
we
should
abrogate
again
many
a
truth
that
seemed
to
be
made
manifest
by
this
concept
yet
this
would
only
evince
a
misunderstanding
on
our
part
without
in
the
least
degree
harming
the
sacred
concept
itself
or
taking
their
sacredness
from
those
truths
that
must
rightly
be
looked
upon
as
its
revelations
man
reaches
beyond
every
individual
man
and
yet
q
though
he
be
his
essence
q
is
not
in
fact
his
essence
which
rather
would
be
as
single
as
he
the
individual
himself
but
a
general
and
higher
yes
for
atheists
the
highest
essence

and
as
the
divine
revelations
were
not
written
down
by
god
with
his
own
hand
but
made
public
through
the
lords
instruments
so
also
the
new
highest
essence
does
not
write
out
its
revelations
itself
but
lets
them
come
to
our
knowledge
through
true
men
only
the
new
essence
betrays
in
fact
a
more
spiritual
style
of
conception
than
the
old
god
because
the
latter
was
still
represented
in
a
sort
of
embodiedness
or
form
while
the
undimmed
spirituality
of
the
new
is
retained
and
no
special
material
body
is
fancied
for
it
and
withal
it
does
not
lack
corporeity
which
even
takes
on
a
yet
more
seductive
appearance
because
it
looks
more
natural
and
mundane
and
consists
in
nothing
less
than
in
every
bodily
man
q
yes
or
outright
in
humanity
or
all
men
thereby
the
spectralness
of
the
spirit
in
a
seemingbody
has
once
again
become
really
solid
and
popular
sacred
then
is
the
highest
essence
and
everything
in
which
this
highest
essence
reveals
or
will
reveal
itself
but
hallowed
are
they
who
recognize
this
highest
essence
together
with
its
own
together
with
its
revelations
the
sacred
hallows
in
turn
its
reverer
who
by
his
worship
becomes
himself
a
saint
as
likewise
what
he
does
is
saintly
a
saintly
walk
saintly
thoughts
and
actions
imaginations
and
aspirations
it
is
easily
understood
that
the
conflict
over
what
is
revered
as
the
highest
essence
can
be
significant
only
so
long
as
even
the
most
embittered
opponents
concede
to
each
other
the
main
point
q
that
there
is
a
highest
essence
to
which
worship
or
service
is
due
if
one
should
smile
compassionately
at
the
whole
struggle
over
a
highest
essence
as
a
christian
might
at
the
war
of
words
between
a
shiite
and
a
sunnite
or
between
a
brahman
and
a
buddhist

then
the
hypothesis
of
a
highest
essence
would
be
null
in
his
eyes
and
the
conflict
on
this
basis
an
idle
play
whether
then
the
one
god
or
the
three
in
one
whether
the
lutheran
god
or
the
tre
suprme
or
not
god
at
all
but
man
may
represent
the
highest
essence
that
makes
no
difference
at
all
for
him
who
denies
the
highest
essence
itself
for
in
his
eyes
those
servants
of
a
highest
essence
are
one
and
all
q
pious
people
the
most
raging
atheist
not
less
than
the
most
faith
filled
christian
in
the
foremost
place
of
the
sacred

then
stands
the
highest
essence
and
the
faith
in
this
essence
our
holy
faith
the
spook
with
ghosts
we
arrive
in
the
spirit
realm
in
the
realm
of
essences
what
haunts
the
universe
and
has
its
occult
incomprehensible
being
there
is
precisely
the
mysterious
spook
that
we
call
highest
essence
and
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
spook
to
comprehend
it
to
discover
reality
in
it
to
prove
the
existence
of
god
q
this
task
men
set
to
themselves
for
thousands
of
years
with
the
horrible
impossibility
the
endless
danaid
labour

of
transforming
the
spook
into
a
non
spook
the
unreal
into
something
real
the
spirit
into
an
entire
and
corporeal
person
q
with
this
they
tormented
themselves
to
death
behind
the
existing
world
they
sought
the
thing
in
itself
the
essence
behind
the
thing
they
sought
the
un
thing
when
one
looks
to
the
bottom
of
anything
searches
out
its
essence
one
often
discovers
something
quite
other
than
what
it
seems
to
be
honeyed
speech
and
a
lying
heart
pompous
words
and
beggarly
thoughts
and
so
on
by
bringing
the
essence
into
prominence
one
degrades
the
hitherto
misapprehended
appearance
to
a
bare
semblance
a
deception
the
essence
of
the
world
so
attractive
and
splendid
is
for
him
who
looks
to
the
bottom
of
it
q
emptiness
emptiness
is
worlds
essence
worlds
doings
now
he
who
is
religious
does
not
occupy
himself
with
the
deceitful
semblance
with
the
empty
appearances
but
looks
upon
the
essence
and
in
the
essence
has
q
the
truth
the
essences
which
are
deduced
from
some
appearances
are
the
evil
essences
and
conversely
from
others
the
good
the
essence
of
human
feeling
for
instance
is
love
the
essence
of
human
will
is
the
good
that
of
ones
thinking
the
true
and
so
on
what
at
first
passed
for
existence
such
as
the
world
and
its
like
appears
now
as
bare
semblance
and
the
truly
existent
is
much
rather
the
essence
whose
realm
is
filled
with
gods
spirits
demons
with
good
or
bad
essences
only
this
inverted
world
the
world
of
essences
truly
exists
now
the
human
heart
may
be
loveless
but
its
essence
exists
god
who
is
love
human
thought
may
wander
in
error
but
its
essence
truth
exists
god
is
truth
and
the
like
to
know
and
acknowledge
essences
alone
and
nothing
but
essences
that
is
religion
its
realm
is
a
realm
of
essences
spooks
and
ghosts
the
longing
to
make
the
spook
comprehensible
or
to
realize
non
sense
has
brought
about
a
corporeal
ghost
a
ghost
or
spirit
with
a
real
body
an
embodied
ghost
how
the
strongest
and
most
talented
christians
have
tortured
themselves
to
get
a
conception
of
this
ghostly
apparition
but
there
always
remained
the
contradiction
of
two
natures
the
divine
and
human
the
ghostly
and
sensual
there
remained
the
most
wondrous
spook
a
thing
that
was
not
a
thing
never
yet
was
a
ghost
more
soul
torturing
and
no
shaman
who
pricks
himself
to
raving
fury
and
nerve
lacerating
cramps
to
conjure
a
ghost
can
endure
such
soul
torment
as
christians
suffered
from
that
most
incomprehensible
ghost
but
through
christ
the
truth
of
the
matter
had
at
the
same
time
come
to
light
that
the
veritable
spirit
or
ghost
is
q
man
the
corporeal
or
embodied
spirit
is
just
man
he
himself
is
the
ghostly
being
and
at
the
same
time
the
beings
appearance
and
existence
henceforth
man
no
longer
in
typical
cases
shudders
at
ghosts
outside
him
but
at
himself
he
is
terrified
at
himself
in
the
depth
of
his
breast
dwells
the
spirit
of
sin
even
the
faintest
thought
and
this
is
itself
a
spirit
you
know
may
be
a
devil
etc
q
the
ghost
has
put
on
a
body
god
has
become
man
but
now
man
is
himself
the
gruesome
spook
which
he
seeks
to
get
back
of
to
exorcise
to
fathom
to
bring
to
reality
and
to
speech
man
is
q
spirit
what
matter
if
the
body
wither
if
only
the
spirit
is
saved
everything
rests
on
the
spirit
and
the
spirits
or
souls
welfare
becomes
the
exclusive
goal
man
has
become
to
himself
a
ghost
an
uncanny
spook
to
which
there
is
even
assigned
a
distinct
seat
in
the
body
dispute
over
the
seat
of
the
soul
whether
in
the
head
etc
you
are
not
to
me
and
i
am
not
to
you
a
higher
essence
nevertheless
a
higher
essence
may
be
hidden
in
each
of
us
and
call
forth
a
mutual
reverence
to
take
at
once
the
most
general
man
lives
in
you
and
me
if
i
did
not
see
man
in
you
what
occasion
should
i
have
to
respect
you
to
be
sure
you
are
not
man
and
his
true
and
adequate
form
but
only
a
mortal
veil
of
his
from
which
he
can
withdraw
without
himself
ceasing
but
yet
for
the
present
this
general
and
higher
essence
is
housed
in
you
and
you
present
before
me
because
an
imperishable
spirit
has
in
you
assumed
a
perishable
body
so
that
really
your
form
is
only
an
assumed
one
a
spirit
that
appears
appears
in
you
without
being
bound
to
your
body
and
to
this
particular
mode
of
appearance
q
therefore
a
spook
hence
i
do
not
regard
you
as
a
higher
essence
but
only
respect
that
higher
essence
which

walks
in
you
i
respect
man
in
you
the
ancients
did
not
observe
anything
of
this
sort
in
their
slaves
and
the
higher
essence
man
found
as
yet
little
response
to
make
up
for
this
they
saw
in
each
other
ghosts
of
another
sort
the
people
is
a
higher
essence
than
an
individual
and
like
man
or
the
spirit
of
man
a
spirit
haunting
the
individual
q
the
spirit
of
the
people
for
this
reason
they
revered
this
spirit
and
only
so
far
as
he
served
this
or
else
a
spirit
related
to
it
as
in
the
spirit
of
the
family
could
the
individual
appear
significant
only
for
the
sake
of
the
higher
essence
the
people
was
consideration
allowed
to
the
member
of
the
people
as
you
are
hallowed
to
us
by
man
who
haunts
you
so
at
every
time
men
have
been
hallowed
by
some
higher
essence
or
other
like
people
family
and
such
only
for
the
sake
of
a
higher
essence
has
any
one
been
honoured
from
of
old
only
as
a
ghost
has
he
been
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
hallowed
a
protected
and
recognized
person
if
i
cherish
you
because
i
hold
you
dear
because
in
you
my
heart
finds
nourishment
my
need
satisfaction
then
it
is
not
done
for
the
sake
of
a
higher
essence
whose
hallowed
body
you
are
not
on
account
of
my
beholding
in
you
a
ghost
an
appearing
spirit
but
from
egoistic
pleasure
you
yourself
with
your
essence
are
valuable
to
me
for
your
essence
is
not
a
higher
one
is
not
higher
and
more
general
than
you
is
unique
like
you
yourself
because
it
is
you
but
it
is
not
only
man
that
haunts
so
does
everything
the
higher
essence
the
spirit
that
walks
in
everything
is
at
the
same
time
bound
to
nothing
and
only
q
appears
in
it
ghosts
in
every
corner
here
would
be
the
place
to
pass
the
haunting
spirits
in
review
if
they
were
not
to
come
before
us
again
further
on
in
order
to
vanish
before
egoism
hence
let
only
a
few
of
them
be
particularized
by
way
of
example
in
order
to
bring
us
at
once
to
our
attitude
toward
them
sacred
above
all
is
the
holy
spirit
sacred
the
truth
sacred
are
right
law
a
good
cause
majesty
marriage
the
common
good
order
the
fatherland
and
so
on
wheels
in
the
head
man
your
head
is
haunted
you
have
wheels
in
your
head
you
imagine
great
things
and
depict
to
yourself
a
whole
world
of
gods
that
has
an
existence
for
you
a
spirit
realm
to
which
you
suppose
yourself
to
be
called
an
ideal
that
beckons
to
you
you
have
a
fixed
idea
do
not
think
that
i
am
jesting
or
speaking
figuratively
when
i
regard
those
persons
who
cling
to
the
higher
and
because
the
vast
majority
belongs
under
this
head
almost
the
whole
world
of
men
as
veritable
fools
fools
in
a
madhouse
what
is
it
then
that
is
called
a
fixed
idea
an
idea
that
has
subjected
the
man
to
itself
when
you
recognize
with
regard
to
such
a
fixed
idea
that
it
is
a
folly
you
shut
its
slave
up
in
an
asylum
and
is
the
truth
of
the
faith
say
which
we
are
not
to
doubt
the
majesty
of
the
people
which
we
are
not
to
strike
at
he
who
does
is
guilty
of
q
lese
majesty
virtue
against
which
the
censor
is
not
to
let
a
word
pass
that
morality
may
be
kept
pure
q
are
these
not
fixed
ideas
is
not
all
the
stupid
chatter
of
most
of
our
newspapers
the
babble
of
fools
who
suffer
from
the
fixed
idea
of
morality
legality
christianity
and
so
forth
and
only
seem
to
go
about
free
because
the
madhouse
in
which
they
walk
takes
in
so
broad
a
space
touch
the
fixed
idea
of
such
a
fool
and
you
will
at
once
have
to
guard
your
back
against
the
lunatics
stealthy
malice
for
these
great
lunatics
are
like
the
little
so
called
lunatics
in
this
point
too
q
that
they
assail
by
stealth
him
who
touches
their
fixed
idea
they
first
steal
his
weapon
steal
free
speech
from
him
and
then
they
fall
upon
him
with
their
nails
every
day
now
lays
bare
the
cowardice
and
vindictiveness
of
these
maniacs
and
the
stupid
populace
hurrahs
for
their
crazy
measures
one
must
read
the
journals
of
this
period
and
must
hear
the
philistines
talk
to
get
the
horrible
conviction
that
one
is
shut
up
in
a
house
with
fools
thou
shalt
not
call
thy
brother
a
fool
if
thou
dost
q
etc
but
i
do
not
fear
the
curse
and
i
say
my
brothers
are
arch
fools
whether
a
poor
fool
of
the
insane
asylum
is
possessed
by
the
fancy
that
he
is
god
the
father
emperor
of
japan
the
holy
spirit
or
whatnot
or
whether
a
citizen
in
comfortable
circumstances
conceives
that
it
is
his
mission
to
be
a
good
christian
a
faithful
protestant
a
loyal
citizen
a
virtuous
man
q
both
these
are
one
and
the
same
fixed
idea
he
who
has
never
tried
and
dared
not
to
be
a
good
christian
a
faithful
protestant
a
virtuous
man
and
the
like
is
possessed
and
prepossessed
by
faith
virtuousness
etc
just
as
the
schoolmen
philosophized
only
inside
the
belief
of
the
church
as
pope
benedict
xiv
wrote
fat
books
inside
the
papist
superstition
without
ever
throwing
a
doubt
upon
this
belief
as
authors
fill
whole
folios
on
the
state
without
calling
in
question
the
fixed
idea
of
the
state
itself
as
our
newspapers
are
crammed
with
politics
because
they
are
conjured
into
the
fancy
that
man
was
created
to
be
a
zoon
politicon
q
so
also
subjects
vegetate
in
subjection
virtuous
people
in
virtue
liberals
in
humanity
without
ever
putting
to
these
fixed
ideas
of
theirs
the
searching
knife
of
criticism
undislodgeable
like
a
madmans
delusion
those
thoughts
stand
on
a
firm
footing
and
he
who
doubts
them
q
lays
hands
on
the
sacred
yes
the
fixed
idea
that
is
the
truly
sacred
is
it
perchance
only
people
possessed
by
the
devil
that
meet
us
or
do
we
as
often
come
upon
people
possessed
in
the
contrary
way
q
possessed
by
the
good
by
virtue
morality
the
law
or
some
principle
or
other
possessions
of
the
devil
are
not
the
only
ones
god
works
on
us
and
the
devil
does
the
former
workings
of
grace
the
latter
workings
of
the
devil
possessed
people
are
set
in
their
opinions
if
the
word
possession
displeases
you
then
call
it
prepossession
yes
since
the
spirit
possesses
you
and
all
inspirations
come
from
it
call
it
q
inspiration
and
enthusiasm
i
add
that
complete
enthusiasm
q
for
we
cannot
stop
with
the
sluggish
half
way
kind
q
is
called
fanaticism
it
is
precisely
among
cultured
people
that
fanaticism
is
at
home
for
man
is
cultured
so
far
as
he
takes
an
interest
in
spiritual
things
and
interest
in
spiritual
things
when
it
is
alive
is
and
must
be
fanaticism
it
is
a
fanatical
interest
in
the
sacred
fanum
observe
our
liberals
look
into
the
s
holbachs
company
constituted
a
regular
plot
against
the
traditional
doctrine
and
the
existing
system
and
its
members
were
as
fanatical
on
behalf
of
their
unbelief
as
monks
and
priests
jesuits
and
pietists
methodists
missionary
and
bible
societies
commonly
are
for
mechanical
worship
and
orthodoxy
take
notice
how
a
moral
man
behaves
who
today
often
thinks
he
is
through
with
god
and
throws
off
christianity
as
a
bygone
thing
if
you
ask
him
whether
he
has
ever
doubted
that
the
copulation
of
brother
and
sister
is
incest
that
monogamy
is
the
truth
of
marriage
that
filial
piety
is
a
sacred
duty
then
a
moral
shudder
will
come
over
him
at
the
conception
of
ones
being
allowed
to
touch
his
sister
as
wife
also
and
whence
this
shudder
because
he
believes
in
those
moral
commandments
this
moral
faith
is
deeply
rooted
in
his
breast
much
as
he
rages
against
the
pious
christians
he
himself
has
nevertheless
as
thoroughly
remained
a
christian
q
to
wit
a
moral
christian
in
the
form
of
morality
christianity
holds
him
a
prisoner
and
a
prisoner
under
faith
monogamy
is
to
be
something
sacred
and
he
who
may
live
in
bigamy
is
punished
as
a
criminal
he
who
commits
incest
suffers
as
a
criminal
those
who
are
always
crying
that
religion
is
not
to
be
regarded
in
the
state
and
the
jew
is
to
be
a
citizen
equally
with
the
christian
show
themselves
in
accord
with
this
is
not
this
of
incest
and
monogamy
a
dogma
of
faith
touch
it
and
you
will
learn
by
experience
how
this
moral
man
is
a
hero
of
faith
too
not
less
than
krummacher

not
less
than
philip
ii

these
fight
for
the
faith
of
the
church
he
for
the
faith
of
the
state
or
the
moral
laws
of
the
state
for
articles
of
faith
both
condemn
him
who
acts
otherwise
than
their
faith
will
allow
the
brand
of
crime
is
stamped
upon
him
and
he
may
languish
in
reformatories
in
jails
moral
faith
is
as
fanatical
as
religious
faith
they
call
that
liberty
of
faith
then
when
brother
and
sister
on
account
of
a
relation
that
they
should
have
settled
with
their
conscience
are
thrown
into
prison
but
they
set
a
pernicious
example
yes
indeed
others
might
have
taken
the
notion
that
the
state
had
no
business
to
meddle
with
their
relation
and
thereupon
purity
of
morals
would
go
to
ruin
so
then
the
religious
heroes
of
faith
are
zealous
for
the
sacred
god
the
moral
ones
for
the
sacred
good
those
who
are
zealous
for
something
sacred
often
look
very
little
like
each
other
how
the
strictly
orthodox
or
old
style
believers
differ
from
the
fighters
for
truth
light
and
justice
from
the
philalethes
the
friends
of
light
the
rationalists
and
others
and
yet
how
utterly
unessential
is
this
difference
if
one
buffets
single
traditional
truths
miracles
unlimited
power
of
princes
then
the
rationalists
buffet
them
too
and
only
the
old
style
believers
wail
but
if
one
buffets
truth
itself
he
immediately
has
both
as
believers
for
opponents
so
with
moralities
the
strict
believers
are
relentless
the
clearer
heads
are
more
tolerant
but
he
who
attacks
morality
itself
gets
both
to
deal
with
truth
morality
justice
light
etc
are
to
be
and
remain
sacred
what
any
one
finds
to
censure
in
christianity
is
simply
supposed
to
be
unchristian
according
to
the
view
of
these
rationalists
but
christianity
must
remain
a
fixture
to
buffet
it
is
outrageous
an
outrage
to
be
sure
the
heretic
against
pure
faith
no
longer
exposes
himself
to
the
earlier
fury
of
persecution
but
so
much
the
more
does
it
now
fall
upon
the
heretic
against
pure
morals
piety
has
for
a
century
received
so
many
blows
and
had
to
hear
its
superhuman
essence
reviled
as
an
inhuman
one
so
often
that
one
cannot
feel
tempted
to
draw
the
sword
against
it
again
and
yet
it
has
almost
always
been
only
moral
opponents
that
have
appeared
in
the
arena
to
assail
the
supreme
essence
in
favour
of
q
another
supreme
essence
so
proudhon
unabashed
says

man
is
destined
to
live
without
religion
but
the
moral
law
is
eternal
and
absolute
who
would
dare
today
to
attack
morality
moral
people
skimmed
off
the
best
fat
from
religion
ate
it
themselves
and
are
now
having
a
tough
job
to
get
rid
of
the
resulting
scrofula
if
therefore
we
point
out
that
religion
has
not
by
any
means
been
hurt
in
its
inmost
part
so
long
as
people
reproach
it
only
with
its
superhuman
essence
and
that
it
takes
its
final
appeal
to
the
spirit
alone
for
god
is
spirit
then
we
have
sufficiently
indicated
its
final
accord
with
morality
and
can
leave
its
stubborn
conflict
with
the
latter
iying
behind
us
it
is
a
question
of
a
supreme
essence
with
both
and
whether
this
is
a
superhuman
or
a
human
one
can
make
since
it
is
in
any
case
an
essence
over
me
a
super
mine
one
so
to
speak
but
little
difference
to
me
in
the
end
the
relation
to
the
human
essence
or
to
man
as
soon
as
ever
it
has
shed
the
snake
skin
of
the
old
religion
will
yet
wear
a
religious
snake
skin
again
so
feuerbach
instructs
us
that
if
one
only
inverts
speculative
philosophy
always
makes
the
predicate
the
subject
and
so
makes
the
subject
the
object
and
principle
one
has
the
undraped
truth
pure
and
clean

herewith
to
be
sure
we
lost
the
narrow
religious
stand
point
lost
the
god
who
from
this
stand
point
is
subject
but
we
take
in
exchange
for
it
the
other
side
of
the
religious
stand
point
the
moral
stand
point
thus
we
no
longer
say
god
is
love
but
love
is
divine
if
we
further
put
in
place
of
the
predicate
divine
the
equivalent
sacred
then
as
far
as
concerns
the
sense
all
the
old
comes
back
again
according
to
this
love
is
to
be
the
good
in
man
his
divineness
that
which
does
him
honour
his
true
humanity
it
makes
him
man
for
the
first
time
makes
for
the
first
time
a
man
out
of
him
so
then
it
would
be
more
accurately
worded
thus
love
is
what
is
human
in
man
and
what
is
inhuman
is
the
loveless
egoist
but
precisely
all
that
which
christianity
and
with
it
speculative
philosophy
i
e
theology
offers
as
the
good
the
absolute
is
to
self
ownership
simply
not
the
good
or
what
means
the
same
it
is
only
the
good
consequently
by
the
transformation
of
the
predicate
into
the
subject
the
christian
essence
and
it
is
the
predicate
that
contains
the
essence
you
know
would
only
be
fixed
yet
more
oppressively
god
and
the
divine
would
entwine
themselves
all
the
more
inextricably
with
me
to
expel
god
from
his
heaven
and
to
rob
him
of
his
transcendence
cannot
yet
support
a
claim
of
complete
victory
if
therein
he
is
only
chased
into
the
human
breast
and
gifted
with
indelible
immanence
now
they
say
the
divine
is
the
truly
human
the
same
people
who
oppose
christianity
as
the
basis
of
the
state
who
oppose
the
so
called
christian
state
do
not
tire
of
repeating
that
morality
is
the
fundamental
pillar
of
social
life
and
of
the
state
as
if
the
dominion
of
morality
were
not
a
complete
dominion
of
the
sacred
a
hierarchy
so
we
may
here
mention
by
the
way
that
rationalist
movement
which
after
theologians
had
long
insisted
that
only
faith
was
capable
of
grasping
religious
truths
that
only
to
believers
did
god
reveal
himself
and
that
therefore
only
the
heart
the
feelings
the
believing
fancy
was
religious
broke
out
with
the
assertion
that
the
natural
understanding
human
reason
was
also
capable
of
discerning
god
what
does
that
mean
but
that
the
reason
laid
claim
to
be
the
same
visionary
as
the
fancy

in
this
sense
reimaruswrote
his
most
notable
truths
of
natural
religion
it
had
to
come
to
this
q
that
the
whole
man
with
all
his
faculties
was
found
to
be
religious
heart
and
affections
understanding
and
reason
feeling
knowledge
and
will
q
in
short
everything
in
man
q
appeared
religious
hegel
has
shown
that
even
philosophy
is
religious
and
what
is
not
called
religion
today
the
religion
of
love
the
religion
of
freedom
political
religion
q
in
short
every
enthusiasm
so
it
is
too
in
fact
to
this
day
we
use
the
romance
word
religion
which
expresses
the
concept
of
a
condition
of
being
bound
to
be
sure
we
remain
bound
so
far
as
religion
takes
possession
of
our
inward
parts
but
is
the
mind
also
bound
on
the
contrary
that
is
free
is
sole
lord
is
not
our
mind
but
absolute
therefore
the
correct
affirmative
translation
of
the
word
religion
would
be
freedom
of
mind
in
whomsoever
the
mind
is
free
he
is
religious
in
just
the
same
way
as
he
in
whom
the
senses
have
free
course
is
called
a
sensual
man
the
mind
binds
the
former
the
desires
the
latter
religion
therefore
is
boundness
or
religio
with
reference
to
me
q
i
am
bound
it
is
freedom
with
reference
to
the
mind
q
the
mind
is
free
or
has
freedom
of
mind
many
know
from
experience
how
hard
it
is
on
us
when
the
desires
run
away
with
us
free
and
unbridled
but
that
the
free
mind
splendid
intellectuality
enthusiasm
for
intellectual
interests
or
however
this
jewel
may
in
the
most
various
phrase
be
named
brings
us
into
yet
more
grievous
straits
than
even
the
wildest
impropriety
people
will
not
perceive
nor
can
they
perceive
it
without
being
consciously
egoists
reimarus
and
all
who
have
shown
that
our
reason
our
heart
etc
also
lead
to
god
have
therewithal
shown
that
we
are
possessed
through
and
through
to
be
sure
they
vexed
the
theologians
from
whom
they
took
away
the
prerogative
of
religious
exaltation
but
for
religion
for
freedom
of
mind
they
thereby
conquered
yet
more
ground
for
when
the
mind
is
no
longer
limited
to
feeling
or
faith
but
also
as
understanding
reason
and
thought
in
general
belongs
to
itself
the
mind
q
when
therefore
it
may
take
part
in
the
spiritual
and
heavenly
truths
in
the
form
of
understanding
as
well
as
in
its
other
forms
q
then
the
whole
mind
is
occupied
only
with
spiritual
things
that
is
with
itself
and
is
therefore
free
now
we
are
so
through
and
through
religious
that
jurors
sworn
men
condemn
us
to
death
and
every
policeman
as
a
good
christian
takes
us
to
the
lock
up
by
virtue
of
an
oath
of
office
morality
could
not
come
into
opposition
with
piety
till
after
the
time
when
in
general
the
boisterous
hate
of
everything
that
looked
like
an
order
decrees
commandments
etc
spoke
out
in
revolt
and
the
personal
absolute
lord
was
scoffed
at
and
persecuted
consequently
it
could
arrive
at
independence
only
through
liberalism
whose
first
form
acquired
significance
in
the
worlds
history
as
citizenship
and
weakened
the
specifically
religious
powers
see
liberalism
below
for
when
morality
not
merely
goes
alongside
of
piety
but
stands
on
feet
of
its
own
then
its
principle
lies
no
longer
in
the
divine
commandments
but
in
the
law
of
reason
from
which
the
commandments
so
far
as
they
are
still
to
remain
valid
must
first
await
justification
for
their
validity
in
the
law
of
reason
man
determines
himself
out
of
himself
for
man
is
rational
and
out
of
the
essence
of
man
those
laws
follow
of
necessity
piety
and
morality
part
company
in
this
q
that
the
former
makes
god
the
law
giver
the
latter
man
from
a
certain
stand
point
of
morality
people
reason
about
as
follows
either
man
is
led
by
his
sensuality
and
is
following
it
immoral
or
he
is
led
by
the
good
which
taken
up
into
the
will
is
called
moral
sentiment
sentiment
and
prepossession
in
favour
of
the
good
then
he
shows
himself
moral
from
this
point
of
view
how
for
instance
can
sands
act
against
kotzebue
be
called
immoral

what
is
commonly
understood
by
unselfish
it
certainly
was
in
the
same
measure
as
among
other
things
st
crispins
thieveries
in
favour
of
the
poor
he
should
not
have
murdered
for
it
stands
written
thou
shalt
not
murder
then
to
serve
the
good
the
welfare
of
the
people
as
sand
at
least
intended
or
the
welfare
of
the
poor
like
crispin
q
is
moral
but
murder
and
theft
are
immoral
the
purpose
moral
the
means
immoral
why
because
murder
assassination
is
something
absolutely
bad
when
the
guerrillas
enticed
the
enemies
of
the
country
into
ravines
and
shot
them
down
unseen
from
the
bushes
do
you
suppose
that
was
assassination
according
to
the
principle
of
morality
which
commands
us
to
serve
the
good
you
could
really
ask
only
whether
murder
could
never
in
any
case
be
a
realization
of
the
good
and
would
have
to
endorse
that
murder
which
realized
the
good
you
cannot
condemn
sands
deed
at
all
it
was
moral
because
in
the
service
of
the
good
because
unselfish
it
was
an
act
of
punishment
which
the
individual
inflicted
an
q
execution
inflicted
at
the
risk
of
the
executioners
life
what
else
had
his
scheme
been
after
all
but
that
he
wanted
to
suppress
writings
by
brute
force
are
you
not
acquainted
with
the
same
procedure
as
a
legal
and
sanctioned
one
and
what
can
be
objected
against
it
from
your
principle
of
morality
q
but
it
was
an
illegal
execution
so
the
immoral
thing
in
it
was
the
illegality
the
disobedience
to
law
then
you
admit
that
the
good
is
nothing
else
than
q
law
morality
nothing
else
than
loyalty
and
to
this
externality
of
loyalty
your
morality
must
sink
to
this
righteousness
of
works
in
the
fulfilment
of
the
law
only
that
the
latter
is
at
once
more
tyrannical
and
more
revolting
than
the
old
time
righteousness
of
works
for
in
the
latter
only
the
act
is
needed
but
you
require
the
disposition
too
one
must
carry
in
himself
the
law
the
statute
and
he
who
is
most
legally
disposed
is
the
most
moral
even
the
last
vestige
of
cheerfulness
in
catholic
life
must
perish
in
this
protestant
legality
here
at
last
the
domination
of
the
law
is
for
the
first
time
complete
not
i
live
but
the
law
lives
in
me
thus
i
have
really
come
so
far
to
be
only
the
vessel
of
its
glory
every
prussian
carries
his
gendarme
in
his
breast
says
a
high
prussian
officer
why
do
certain
opposition
parties
fail
to
flourish
solely
for
the
reason
that
they
refuse
to
forsake
the
path
of
morality
or
legality
hence
the
measureless
hypocrisy
of
devotion
love
etc
from
whose
repulsiveness
one
may
daily
get
the
most
thorough
nausea
at
this
rotten
and
hypocritical
relation
of
a
lawful
opposition
q
in
the
moral
relation
of
love
and
fidelity
a
divided
or
opposed
will
cannot
have
place
the
beautiful
relation
is
disturbed
if
the
one
wills
this
and
the
other
the
reverse
but
now
according
to
the
practice
hitherto
and
the
old
prejudice
of
the
opposition
the
moral
relation
is
to
be
preserved
above
all
what
is
then
left
to
the
opposition
perhaps
the
will
to
have
a
liberty
if
the
beloved
one
sees
fit
to
deny
it
not
a
bit
it
may
not
will
to
have
the
freedom
it
can
only
wish
for
it
petition
for
it
lisp
a
please
please
what
would
come
of
it
if
the
opposition
really
willed
willed
with
the
full
energy
of
the
will
no
it
must
renounce
will
in
order
to
live
to
love
renounce
liberty
q
for
love
of
morality
it
may
never
claim
as
a
right
what
it
is
permitted
only
to
beg
as
a
favour
love
devotion
etc
demand
with
undeviating
definiteness
that
there
be
only
one
will
to
which
the
others
devote
themselves
which
they
serve
follow
love
whether
this
will
is
regarded
as
reasonable
or
as
unreasonable
in
both
cases
one
acts
morally
when
one
follows
it
and
immorally
when
one
breaks
away
from
it
the
will
that
commands
the
censorship
seems
to
many
unreasonable
but
he
who
in
a
land
of
censorship
evades
the
censoring
of
his
book
acts
immorally
and
he
who
submits
it
to
the
censorship
acts
morally
if
some
one
let
his
moral
judgment
go
and
set
up
a
secret
press
one
would
have
to
call
him
immoral
and
imprudent
in
the
bargain
if
he
let
himself
be
caught
but
will
such
a
man
lay
claim
to
a
value
in
the
eyes
of
the
moral
perhaps
q
that
is
if
he
fancied
he
was
serving
a
higher
morality
the
web
of
the
hypocrisy
of
today
hangs
on
the
frontiers
of
two
domains
between
which
our
time
swings
back
and
forth
attaching
its
fine
threads
of
deception
and
self
deception
no
longer
vigorous
enough
to
serve
morality
without
doubt
or
weakening
not
yet
reckless
enough
to
live
wholly
to
egoism
it
trembles
now
toward
the
one
and
now
toward
the
other
in
the
spider
web
of
hypocrisy
and
crippled
by
the
curse
of
halfness
catches
only
miserable
stupid
flies
if
one
has
once
dared
to
make
a
free
motion
immediately
one
waters
it
again
with
assurances
of
love
and
q
shams
resignation
if
on
the
other
side
they
have
had
the
face
to
reject
the
free
motion
with
moral
appeals
to
confidence
immediately
the
moral
courage
also
sinks
and
they
assure
one
how
they
hear
the
free
words
with
special
pleasure
they
sham
approval
in
short
people
would
like
to
have
the
one
but
not
go
without
the
other
they
would
like
to
have
a
free
will
but
not
for
their
lives
lack
the
moral
will
just
come
in
contact
with
a
servile
loyalist
you
liberals

you
will
sweeten
every
word
of
freedom
with
a
look
of
the
most
loyal
confidence
and
he
will
clothe
his
servilism
in
the
most
flattering
phrases
of
freedom
then
you
go
apart
and
he
like
you
thinks
i
know
you
fox
he
scents
the
devil
in
you
as
much
as
you
do
the
dark
old
lord
god
in
him
a
nero
is
a
bad
man
only
in
the
eyes
of
the
good
in
mine
he
is
nothing
but
a
possessed
man
as
are
the
good
too
the
good
see
in
him
an
arch
villain
and
relegate
him
to
hell
why
did
nothing
hinder
him
in
his
arbitrary
course
why
did
people
put
up
with
so
much
do
you
suppose
the
tame
romans
who
let
all
their
will
be
bound
by
such
a
tyrant
were
a
hair
the
better
in
old
rome
they
would
have
put
him
to
death
instantly
would
never
have
been
his
slaves
but
the
contemporary
good
among
the
romans
opposed
to
him
only
moral
demands
not
their
will
they
sighed
that
their
emperor
did
not
do
homage
to
morality
like
them
they
themselves
remained
moral
subjects
till
at
last
one
found
courage
to
give
up
moral
obedient
subjection
and
then
the
same
good
romans
who
as
obedient
subjects
had
borne
all
the
ignominy
of
having
no
will
hurrahed
over
the
nefarious
immoral
act
of
the
rebel
where
then
in
the
good
was
the
courage
for
the
revolution
that
courage
which
they
now
praised
after
another
had
mustered
it
up
the
good
could
not
have
this
courage
for
a
revolution
and
an
insurrection
into
the
bargain
is
always
something
immoral
which
one
can
resolve
upon
only
when
one
ceases
to
be
good
and
becomes
either
bad
or
q
neither
of
the
two
nero
was
no
viler
than
his
time
in
which
one
could
only
be
one
of
the
two
good
or
bad
the
judgment
of
his
time
on
him
had
to
be
that
he
was
bad
and
this
in
the
highest
degree
not
a
milksop
but
an
arch
scoundrel
all
moral
people
can
pronounce
only
this
judgment
on
him
rascals
such
as
he
was
are
still
living
here
and
there
today
see
for
example
the
memoirs
of
ritter
von
lang
in
the
midst
of
the
moral
it
is
not
convenient
to
live
among
them
certainly
as
one
is
not
sure
of
his
life
for
a
moment
but
can
you
say
that
it
is
more
convenient
to
live
among
the
moral
one
is
just
as
little
sure
of
his
life
there
only
that
one
is
hanged
in
the
way
of
justice
but
least
of
all
is
one
sure
of
his
honour
and
the
national
cockade
is
gone
before
you
can
say
jack
robinson
the
hard
fist
of
morality
treats
the
noble
nature
of
egoism
altogether
without
compassion
but
surely
one
cannot
put
a
rascal
and
an
honest
man
on
the
same
level
now
no
human
being
does
that
oftener
than
you
judges
of
morals
yes
still
more
than
that
you
imprison
as
a
criminal
an
honest
man
who
speaks
openly
against
the
existing
constitution
against
the
hallowed
institutions
and
you
entrust
portfolios
and
still
more
important
things
to
a
crafty
rascal
so
in
praxi
you
have
nothing
to
reproach
me
with
but
in
theory
now
there
i
do
put
both
on
the
same
level
as
two
opposite
poles
q
to
wit
both
on
the
level
of
the
moral
law
both
have
meaning
only
in
the
moral
world
just
as
in
the
pre
christian
time
a
jew
who
kept
the
law
and
one
who
broke
it
had
meaning
and
significance
only
in
respect
to
the
jewish
law
before
jesus
christ
on
the
contrary
the
pharisee
was
no
more
than
the
sinner
and
publican
so
before
self
ownership
the
moral
pharisee
amounts
to
as
much
as
the
immoral
sinner
nero
became
very
inconvenient
by
his
possessedness
but
a
self
owning
man
would
not
sillily
oppose
to
him
the
sacred
and
whine
if
the
tyrant
does
not
regard
the
sacred
he
would
oppose
to
him
his
will
how
often
the
sacredness
of
the
inalienable
rights
of
man
has
been
held
up
to
their
foes
and
some
liberty
or
other
shown
and
demonstrated
to
be
a
sacred
right
of
man
those
who
do
that
deserve
to
be
laughed
out
of
court
q
as
they
actually
are
q
were
it
not
that
in
truth
they
do
even
though
unconsciously
take
the
road
that
leads
to
the
goal
they
have
a
presentiment
that
if
only
the
majority
is
once
won
for
that
liberty
it
will
also
will
the
liberty
and
will
then
take
what
it
will
have
the
sacredness
of
the
liberty
and
all
possible
proofs
of
this
sacredness
will
never
procure
it
lamenting
and
petitioning
only
shows
beggars
the
moral
man
is
necessarily
narrow
in
that
he
knows
no
other
enemy
than
the
immoral
man
he
who
is
not
moral
is
immoral
and
accordingly
reprobate
despicable
etc
therefore
the
moral
man
can
never
comprehend
the
egoist
is
not
unwedded
cohabitation
an
immorality
the
moral
man
may
turn
as
he
pleases
he
will
have
to
stand
by
this
verdict
emilia
galotti
gave
up
her
life
for
this
moral
truth
and
it
is
true
it
is
an
immorality
a
virtuous
girl
may
become
an
old
maid
a
virtuous
man
may
pass
the
time
in
fighting
his
natural
impulses
till
he
has
perhaps
dulled
them
he
may
castrate
himself
for
the
sake
of
virtue
as
st
origen
did
for
the
sake
of
heaven
he
thereby
honours
sacred
wedlock
sacred
chastity
as
inviolable
he
is
q
moral
unchastity
can
never
become
a
moral
act
however
indulgently
the
moral
man
may
judge
and
excuse
him
who
committed
it
it
remains
a
transgression
a
sin
against
a
moral
commandment
there
clings
to
it
an
indelible
stain
as
chastity
once
belonged
to
the
monastic
vow
so
it
does
to
moral
conduct
chastity
is
a
q
good
q
for
the
egoist
on
the
contrary
even
chastity
is
not
a
good
without
which
he
could
not
get
along
he
cares
nothing
at
all
about
it
what
now
follows
from
this
for
the
judgment
of
the
moral
man
this
that
he
throws
the
egoist
into
the
only
class
of
men
that
he
knows
besides
moral
men
into
that
of
tho
immoral
he
cannot
do
otherwise
he
must
find
the
egoist
immoral
in
everything
in
which
the
egoist
disregards
morality
if
he
did
not
find
him
so
then
he
would
already
have
become
an
apostate
from
morality
without
confessing
it
to
himself
he
would
already
no
longer
be
a
truly
moral
man
one
should
not
let
himself
be
led
astray
by
such
phenomena
which
at
the
present
day
are
certainly
no
longer
to
be
classed
as
rare
but
should
reflect
that
he
who
yields
any
point
of
morality
can
as
little
be
counted
among
the
truly
moral
as
lessing
was
a
pious
christian
when
in
the
well
known
parable
he
compared
the
christian
religion
as
well
as
the
mohammedan
and
jewish
to
a
counterfeit
ring
often
people
are
already
further
than
they
venture
to
confess
to
themselves
for
socrates
because
in
culture
he
stood
on
the
level
of
morality
it
would
have
been
an
immorality
if
he
had
been
willing
to
follow
critos
seductive
incitement
and
escape
from
the
dungeon
to
remain
was
the
only
moral
thing
but
it
was
solely
because
socrates
was
q
a
moral
man
the
unprincipled
sacrilegious
men
of
the
revolution
on
the
contrary
had
sworn
fidelity
to
louis
xvi

and
decreed
his
deposition
yes
his
death
but
the
act
was
an
immoral
one
at
which
moral
persons
will
be
horrified
to
all
eternity
yet
all
this
applies
more
or
less
only
to
civic
morality
on
which
the
freer
look
down
with
contempt
for
it
like
civism
its
native
ground
in
general
is
still
too
little
removed
and
free
from
the
religious
heaven
not
to
transplant
the
latters
laws
without
criticism
or
further
consideration
to
its
domain
instead
of
producing
independent
doctrines
of
its
own
morality
cuts
a
quite
different
figure
when
it
arrives
at
the
consciousness
of
its
dignity
and
raises
its
principle
the
essence
of
man
or
man
to
be
the
only
regulative
power
those
who
have
worked
their
way
through
to
such
a
decided
consciousness
break
entirely
with
religion
whose
god
no
longer
finds
any
place
alongside
their
man
and
as
they
see
below
themselves
scuttle
the
ship
of
state
so
too
they
crumble
away
that
morality
which
flourishes
only
in
the
state
and
logically
have
no
right
to
use
even
its
name
any
further
for
what
this
critical
party
calls
morality
is
very
positively
distinguished
from
the
so
called
civic
or
political
morality
and
must
appear
to
the
citizen
like
an
insensate
and
unbridled
liberty
but
at
bottom
it
has
only
the
advantage
of
the
purity
of
the
principle
which
freed
from
its
defilement
with
the
religious
has
now
reached
universal
power
in
its
clarified
definiteness
as
humanity

therefore
one
should
not
wonder
that
the
name
morality
is
retained
along
with
others
like
freedom
benevolence
self
consciousness
and
is
only
garnished
now
and
then
with
the
addition
a
free
morality
just
as
though
the
civic
state
is
abused
yet
the
state
is
to
arise
again
as
a
free
state
or
if
not
even
so
yet
as
a
free
society
because
this
morality
completed
into
humanity
has
fully
settled
its
accounts
with
the
religion
out
of
which
it
historically
came
forth
nothing
hinders
it
from
becoming
a
religion
on
its
own
account
for
a
distinction
prevails
between
religion
and
morality
only
so
long
as
our
dealings
with
the
world
of
men
are
regulated
and
hallowed
by
our
relation
to
a
superhuman
being
or
so
long
as
our
doing
is
a
doing
for
gods
sake
if
on
the
other
hand
it
comes
to
the
point
that
man
is
to
man
the
supreme
being
then
that
distinction
vanishes
and
morality
being
removed
from
its
subordinate
position
is
completed
into
q
religion
for
then
the
higher
being
who
had
hitherto
been
subordinated
to
the
highest
man
has
ascended
to
absolute
height
and
we
are
related
to
him
as
one
is
related
to
the
highest
being
religiously
morality
and
piety
are
now
as
synonymous
as
in
the
beginning
of
christianity
and
it
is
only
because
the
supreme
being
has
come
to
be
a
different
one
that
a
holy
walk
is
no
longer
called
a
holy
one
but
a
human
one
if
morality
has
conquered
then
a
complete
q
change
of
masters
has
taken
place
after
the
annihilation
of
faith
feuerbach
thinks
to
put
in
to
the
supposedly
safe
harbour
of
love
the
first
and
highest
law
must
be
the
love
of
man
to
man
homo
homini
deus
est
q
this
is
the
supreme
practical
maxim
this
is
the
turning
point
of
the
worlds
history

but
properly
speaking
only
the
god
is
changed
q
the
deus
love
has
remained
there
love
to
the
superhuman
god
here
love
to
the
human
god
to
homo
as
deus
therefore
man
is
to
me
q
sacred
and
everything
truly
human
is
to
me
q
sacred
marriage
is
sacred
of
itself
and
so
it
is
with
all
moral
relations
friendship
is
and
must
be
sacred
for
you
and
property
and
marriage
and
the
good
of
every
man
but
sacred
in
and
of
itself

havent
we
the
priest
again
there
who
is
his
god
man
with
a
great
m
what
is
the
divine
the
human
then
the
predicate
has
indeed
only
been
changed
into
the
subject
and
instead
of
the
sentence
god
is
love
they
say
love
is
divine
instead
of
god
has
become
man
man
has
become
god
etc
it
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
new
q
religion
all
moral
relations
are
ethical
are
cultivated
with
a
moral
mind
only
where
of
themselves
without
religious
consecration
by
the
priests
blessing
they
are
counted
religious
feuerbachs
proposition
theology
is
anthropology
means
only
religion
must
be
ethics
ethics
alone
is
religion
altogether
feuerbach
accomplishes
only
a
transposition
of
subject
and
predicate
a
giving
of
preference
to
the
latter
but
since
he
himself
says
love
is
not
and
has
never
been
considered
by
men
sacred
through
being
a
predicate
of
god
but
it
is
a
predicate
of
god
because
it
is
divine
in
and
of
itself
he
might
judge
that
the
fight
against
the
predicates
themselves
against
love
and
all
sanctities
must
be
commenced
how
could
he
hope
to
turn
men
away
from
god
when
he
left
them
the
divine
and
if
as
feuerbach
says
god
himself
has
never
been
the
main
thing
to
them
but
only
his
predicates
then
he
might
have
gone
on
leaving
them
the
tinsel
longer
yet
since
the
doll
the
real
kernel
was
left
at
any
rate
he
recognizes
too
that
with
him
it
is
only
a
matter
of
annihilating
an
illusion

he
thinks
however
that
the
effect
of
the
illusion
on
men
is
downright
ruinous
since
even
love
in
itself
the
truest
most
inward
sentiment
becomes
an
obscure
illusory
one
through
religiousness
since
religious
love
loves
man
only
for
gods
sake
therefore
loves
man
only
apparently
but
in
truth
god
only
is
this
different
with
moral
love
does
it
love
the
man
this
man
for
this
mans
sake
or
for
moralitys
sake
and
so
q
for
homo
homini
deus
q
for
gods
sake

the
wheels
in
the
head
have
a
number
of
other
formal
aspects
some
of
which
it
may
be
useful
to
indicate
here
thus
self
renunciation
is
common
to
the
holy
with
the
unholy
to
the
pure
and
the
impure
the
impure
man
renounces
all
better
feelings
all
shame
even
natural
timidity
and
follows
only
the
appetite
that
rules
him
the
pure
man
renounces
his
natural
relation
to
the
world
renounces
the
world
and
follows
only
the
desire
which
rules
him
driven
by
the
thirst
for
money
the
avaricious
man
renounces
all
admonitions
of
conscience
all
feeling
of
honour
all
gentleness
and
all
compassion
he
puts
all
considerations
out
of
sight
the
appetite
drags
him
along
the
holy
man
behaves
similarly
he
makes
himself
the
laughing
stock
of
the
world
is
hard
hearted
and
strictly
just
for
the
desire
drags
him
along
as
the
unholy
man
renounces
himself
before
mammon
so
the
holy
man
renounces
himself
before
god
and
the
divine
laws
we
are
now
living
in
a
time
when
the
shamelessness
of
the
holy
is
every
day
more
and
more
felt
and
uncovered
whereby
it
is
at
the
same
time
compelled
to
unveil
itself
and
lay
itself
bare
more
and
more
every
day
have
not
the
shamelessness
and
stupidity
of
the
reasons
with
which
men
antagonize
the
progress
of
the
age
long
surpassed
all
measure
and
all
expectation
but
it
must
be
so
the
self
renouncers
must
as
holy
men
take
the
same
course
that
they
do
so
as
unholy
men
as
the
latter
little
by
little
sink
to
the
fullest
measure
of
self
renouncing
vulgarity
and
lowness
so
the
former
must
ascend
to
the
most
dishonourable
exaltation
the
mammon
of
the
earth
and
the
god
of
heaven
both
demand
exactly
the
same
degree
of
q
self
renunciation
the
low
man
like
the
exalted
one
reaches
out
for
a
good
q
the
former
for
the
material
good
the
latter
for
the
ideal
the
so
called
supreme
good
and
at
last
both
complete
each
other
again
too
as
the
materially
minded
man
sacrifices
everything
to
an
ideal
phantasm
his
vanity
and
the
spirituallyminded
man
to
a
material
gratification
the
life
of
enjoyment
those
who
exhort
men
to
unselfishness

think
they
are
saying
an
uncommon
deal
what
do
they
understand
by
it
probably
something
like
what
they
understand
by
self
renunciation
but
who
is
this
self
that
is
to
be
renounced
and
to
have
no
benefit
it
seems
that
you
yourself
are
supposed
to
be
it
and
for
whose
benefit
is
unselfish
self
renunciation
recommended
to
you
again
for
your
benefit
and
behoof
only
that
through
unselfishness
you
are
procuring
your
true
benefit
you
are
to
benefit
yourself
and
yet
you
are
not
to
seek
your
benefit
people
regard
as
unselfish
the
benefactor
of
men
a
francke
who
founded
the
orphan
asylum
an
oconnell
who
works
tirelessly
for
his
irish
people
but
also
the
fanatic
who
like
st
boniface

hazards
his
life
for
the
conversion
of
the
heathen
or
like
robespierre

sacrifices
everything
to
virtue
like
krner

dies
for
god
king
and
fatherland
hence
among
others
oconnells
opponents
try
to
trump
up
against
him
some
selfishness
or
mercenariness
for
which
the
oconnell
fund
seemed
to
give
them
a
foundation
for
if
they
were
successful
in
casting
suspicion
on
his
unselfishness
they
would
easily
separate
him
from
his
adherents
yet
what
could
they
show
further
than
that
oconnell
was
working
for
another
end
than
the
ostensible
one
but
whether
he
may
aim
at
making
money
or
at
liberating
the
people
it
still
remains
certain
in
one
case
as
in
the
other
that
he
is
striving
for
an
end
and
that
his
end
selfishness
here
as
there
only
that
his
national
self
interest
would
be
beneficial
to
others
too
and
so
would
be
for
the
common
interest
now
do
you
suppose
unselfishness
is
unreal
and
nowhere
extant
on
the
contrary
nothing
is
more
ordinary
one
may
even
call
it
an
article
of
fashion
in
the
civilized
world
which
is
considered
so
indispensable
that
if
it
costs
too
much
in
solid
material
people
at
least
adorn
themselves
with
its
tinsel
counterfeit
and
feign
it
where
does
unselfishness
begin
right
where
an
end
ceases
to
be
our
end
and
our
property
which
we
as
owners
can
dispose
of
at
pleasure
where
it
becomes
a
fixed
end
or
a
q
fixed
idea
where
it
begins
to
inspire
enthuse
fantasize
us
in
short
where
it
passes
into
our
stubbornness
and
becomes
our
q
master
one
is
not
unselfish
so
long
as
he
retains
the
end
in
his
power
one
becomes
so
only
at
that
here
i
stand
i
cannot
do
otherwise
the
fundamental
maxim
of
all
the
possessed
one
becomes
so
in
the
case
of
a
sacred
end
through
the
corresponding
sacred
zeal
i
am
not
unselfish
so
long
as
the
end
remains
my
own
and
i
instead
of
giving
myself
up
to
be
the
blind
means
of
its
fulfilment
leave
it
always
an
open
question
my
zeal
need
not
on
that
account
be
slacker
than
the
most
fanatical
but
at
the
same
time
i
remain
toward
it
frostily
cold
unbelieving
and
its
most
irreconcilable
enemy
i
remain
its
judge
because
i
am
its
owner
unselfishness
grows
rank
as
far
as
possessedness
reaches
as
much
on
possessions
of
the
devil
as
on
those
of
a
good
spirit
there
vice
folly
and
the
like
here
humility
devotion
and
so
forth
where
could
one
look
without
meeting
victims
of
self
renunciation
there
sits
a
girl
opposite
me
who
perhaps
has
been
making
bloody
sacrifices
to
her
soul
for
ten
years
already
over
the
buxom
form
droops
a
deathly
tired
head
and
pale
cheeks
betray
the
slow
bleeding
away
of
her
youth
poor
child
how
often
the
passions
may
have
beaten
at
your
heart
and
the
rich
powers
of
youth
have
demanded
their
right
when
your
head
rolled
in
the
soft
pillow
how
awakening
nature
quivered
through
your
limbs
the
blood
swelled
your
veins
and
fiery
fancies
poured
the
gleam
of
voluptuousness
into
your
eyes
then
appeared
the
ghost
of
the
soul
and
its
eternal
bliss
you
were
terrified
your
hands
folded
themselves
your
tormented
eyes
turned
their
look
upward
you
q
prayed
the
storms
of
nature
were
hushed
a
calm
glided
over
the
ocean
of
your
appetites
slowly
the
weary
eyelids
sank
over
the
life
extinguished
under
them
the
tension
crept
out
unperceived
from
the
rounded
limbs
the
boisterous
waves
dried
up
in
the
heart
the
folded
hands
themselves
rested
a
powerless
weight
on
the
unresisting
bosom
one
last
faint
oh
dear
moaned
itself
away
and
q
the
soul
was
at
rest
you
fell
asleep
to
awake
in
the
morning
to
a
new
combat
and
a
new
q
prayer
now
the
habit
of
renunciation
cools
the
heat
of
your
desire
and
the
roses
of
your
youth
are
growing
pale
in
the
q
chlorosis
of
your
heavenliness
the
soul
is
saved
the
body
may
perish
o
lais
o
ninon

how
well
you
did
to
scorn
this
pale
virtue
one
free
grisette
against
a
thousand
virgins
grown
gray
in
virtue
the
fixed
idea
may
also
be
perceived
as
maxim
principle
stand
point
and
the
like
archimedes
to
move
the
earth
asked
for
a
stan
d
point
outside
it
men
sought
continually
for
this
stand
point
and
every
one
seized
upon
it
as
well
as
he
was
able
this
foreign
stand
point
is
the
world
of
mind
of
ideas
thoughts
concepts
essences
it
is
heaven
heaven
is
the
stand
point
from
which
the
earth
is
moved
earthly
doings
surveyed
and
q
despised
to
assure
to
themselves
heaven
to
occupy
the
heavenly
stand
point
firmly
and
for
ever
q
how
painfully
and
tirelessly
humanity
struggled
for
this
christianity
has
aimed
to
deliver
us
from
a
life
determined
by
nature
from
the
appetites
as
actuating
us
and
so
has
meant
that
man
should
not
let
himself
be
determined
by
his
appetites
this
does
not
involve
the
idea
that
he
was
not
to
have
appetites
but
that
the
appetites
were
not
to
have
him
that
they
were
not
to
become
fixed
uncontrollable
indissoluble
now
could
not
what
christianity
religion
contrived
against
the
appetites
be
applied
by
us
to
its
own
precept
that
mind
thought
conceptions
ideas
faith
must
determine
us
could
we
not
ask
that
neither
should
mind
or
the
conception
the
idea
be
allowed
to
determine
us
to
become
fixed
and
inviolable
or
sacred
then
it
would
end
in
the
dissolution
of
mind
the
dissolution
of
all
thoughts
of
all
conceptions
as
we
there
had
to
say
we
are
indeed
to
have
appetites
but
the
appetites
are
not
to
have
us
so
we
should
now
say
we
are
indeed
to
have
mind
but
mind
is
not
to
have
us
if
the
latter
seems
lacking
in
sense
think
of
the
fact
that
with
so
many
a
man
a
thought
becomes
a
maxim
whereby
he
himself
is
made
prisoner
to
it
so
that
it
is
not
he
that
has
the
maxim
but
rather
it
that
has
him
and
with
the
maxim
he
has
a
permanent
stand
point
again
the
doctrines
of
the
catechism
become
our
principles
before
we
find
it
out
and
no
longer
brook
rejection
their
thought
or
q
mind
has
the
sole
power
and
no
protest
of
the
flesh
is
further
listened
to
nevertheless
it
is
only
through
the
flesh
that
i
can
break
tyranny
of
mind
for
it
is
only
when
a
man
hears
his
flesh
along
with
the
rest
of
him
that
he
hears
himself
wholly
and
it
is
only
when
he
wholly
hears
himself
that
he
is
a
hearing
or
rational
being
the
christian
does
not
hear
the
agony
of
his
enthralled
nature
but
lives
in
humility
therefore
he
does
not
grumble
at
the
wrong
which
befalls
his
person
he
thinks
himself
satisfied
with
the
freedom
of
the
spirit
but
if
the
flesh
once
takes
the
floor
and
its
tone
is
passionate
indecorous
not
well
disposed
spiteful
as
it
cannot
be
otherwise
then
he
thinks
he
hears
voices
of
devils
voices
against
the
spirit
for
decorum
passionlessness
kindly
disposition
and
the
like
is
q
spirit
and
is
justly
zealous
against
them
he
could
not
be
a
christian
if
he
were
willing
to
endure
them
he
listens
only
to
morality
and
slaps
unmorality
in
the
mouth
he
listens
only
to
legality
and
gags
the
lawless
word
the
spirit
of
morality
and
legality
holds
him
a
prisoner
a
rigid
unbending
master
they
call
that
the
mastery
of
the
spirit
q
it
is
at
the
same
time
the
stand
point
of
the
spirit
and
now
whom
do
the
ordinary
liberal
gentlemen
mean
to
make
free
whose
freedom
is
it
that
they
cry
out
and
thirst
for
the
spirits
that
of
the
spirit
of
morality
legality
piety
the
fear
of
god
that
is
what
the
anti
liberal
gentlemen
also
want
and
the
whole
contention
between
the
two
turns
on
a
matter
of
advantage
whether
the
latter
are
to
be
the
only
speakers
or
the
former
are
to
receive
a
share
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
same
advantage
the
spirit
remains
the
absolute
lord
for
both
and
their
only
quarrel
is
over
who
shall
occupy
the
hierarchical
throne
that
pertains
to
the
viceregent
of
the
lord
the
best
of
it
is
that
one
can
calmly
look
upon
the
stir
with
the
certainty
that
the
wild
beasts
of
history
will
tear
each
other
to
pieces
just
like
those
of
nature
their
putrefying
corpses
fertilize
the
ground
for
q
our
crops
we
shall
come
back
later
to
many
another
wheel
in
the
head
q
for
instance
those
of
vocation
truthfulness
love
and
the
like

when
ones
own
is
contrasted
with
what
is
imparted
to
him
there
is
no
use
in
objecting
that
we
cannot
have
anything
isolated
but
receive
everything
as
a
part
of
the
universal
order
and
therefore
through
the
impression
of
what
is
around
us
and
that
consequently
we
have
it
as
something
imparted
for
there
is
a
great
difference
between
the
feelings
and
thoughts
which
are
aroused
in
me
by
other
things
and
those
which
are
given
to
me
god
immortality
freedom
humanity
are
drilled
into
us
from
childhood
as
thoughts
and
feelings
which
move
our
inner
being
more
or
less
strongly
either
ruling
us
without
our
knowing
it
or
sometimes
in
richer
natures
manifesting
themselves
in
systems
and
works
of
art
but
are
always
not
aroused
but
imparted
feelings
because
we
must
believe
in
them
and
cling
to
them
that
an
absolute
existed
and
that
it
must
be
taken
in
felt
and
thought
by
us
was
settled
as
a
faith
in
the
minds
of
those
who
spent
all
the
strength
of
their
mind
on
recognizing
it
and
setting
it
forth
the
feeling
for
the
absolute
exists
there
as
an
imparted
one
and
thenceforth
results
only
in
the
most
manifold
revelations
of
its
own
self
so
in
klopstock
the
religious
feeling
was
an
imparted
one
which
in
the
messias
simply
found
artistic
expression
if
on
the
other
hand
the
religion
with
which
he
was
confronted
had
been
for
him
only
an
incitation
to
feeling
and
thought
and
if
he
had
known
how
to
take
an
attitude
completely
his
own
toward
it
then
there
would
have
resulted
instead
of
religious
inspiration
a
dissolution
and
consumption
of
the
religion
itself
instead
of
that
he
only
continued
in
mature
years
his
childish
feelings
received
in
childhood
and
squandered
the
powers
of
his
manhood
in
decking
out
his
childish
trines
the
difference
is
then
whether
feelings
are
imparted
to
me
or
only
aroused
those
which
are
aroused
are
my
own
egoistic
because
they
are
not
as
feelings
drilled
into
me
dictated
to
me
and
pressed
upon
me
but
those
which
are
imparted
to
me
i
receive
with
open
arms
q
i
cherish
them
in
me
as
a
heritage
cultivate
them
and
am
possessed
by
them
who
is
there
that
has
never
more
or
less
consciously
noticed
that
our
whole
education
is
calculated
to
produce
feelings
in
us
impart
them
to
us
instead
of
leaving
their
production
to
ourselves
however
they
may
turn
out
if
we
hear
the
name
of
god
we
are
to
feel
veneration
if
we
hear
that
of
the
princes
majesty
it
is
to
be
received
with
reverence
deference
submission
if
we
hear
that
of
morality
we
are
to
think
that
we
hear
something
inviolable
if
we
hear
of
the
evil
one
or
evil
ones
we
are
to
shudder
the
intention
is
directed
to
these
feelings
and
he
who
should
hear
with
pleasure
the
deeds
of
the
bad
would
have
to
be
taught
whats
what
with
the
rod
of
discipline
thus
stuffed
with
imparted
feelings
we
appear
before
the
bar
of
majority
and
are
pronounced
of
age
our
equipment
consists
of
elevating
feelings
lofty
thoughts
inspiring
maxims
eternal
principles
the
young
are
of
age
when
they
twitter
like
the
old
they
are
driven
through
school
to
learn
the
old
song
and
when
they
have
this
by
heart
they
are
declared
of
age
we
must
not
feel
at
every
thing
and
every
name
that
comes
before
us
what
we
could
and
would
like
to
feel
thereat
at
the
name
of
god
we
must
think
of
nothing
laughable
feel
nothing
disrespectful
it
being
prescribed
and
imparted
to
us
what
and
how
we
are
to
feel
and
think
at
mention
of
that
name
that
is
the
meaning
of
the
care
of
souls
q
that
my
soul
or
my
mind
be
tuned
as
others
think
right
not
as
i
myself
would
like
it
how
much
trouble
does
it
not
cost
one
finally
to
secure
to
oneself
a
feeling
of
ones
own
at
the
mention
of
at
least
this
or
that
name
and
to
laugh
in
the
face
of
many
who
expect
from
us
a
holy
face
and
a
composed
expression
at
their
speeches
what
is
imparted
is
alien
to
us
is
not
our
own
and
therefore
is
sacred
and
it
is
hard
work
to
lay
aside
the
sacred
dread
of
it
today
one
again
hears
seriousness
praised
seriousness
in
the
presence
of
highly
important
subjects
and
discussions
german
seriousness
and
so
on
this
sort
of
seriousness
proclaims
clearly
how
old
and
grave
lunacy
and
possession
have
already
become
for
there
is
nothing
more
serious
than
a
lunatic
when
he
comes
to
the
central
point
of
his
lunacy
then
his
great
earnestness
incapacitates
him
for
taking
a
joke
see
madhouses

the
hierarchy
the
historical
reflections
on
our
mongolism
which
i
propose
to
insert
episodically
at
this
place
are
not
given
with
the
claim
of
thoroughness
or
even
of
approved
soundness
but
solely
because
it
seems
to
me
that
they
may
contribute
toward
making
the
rest
clear
the
history
of
the
world
whose
shaping
properly
belongs
altogether
to
the
caucasian
race
seems
till
now
to
have
run
through
two
caucasian
ages
in
the
first
of
which
we
had
to
work
out
and
work
off
our
innate
negroidity
this
was
followed
in
the
second
by
mongoloidity
chineseness
which
must
likewise
be
terribly
made
an
end
of
negroidity
represents
antiquity
the
time
of
dependence
on
things
on
cocks
eating
birds
flight
on
sneezing
on
thunder
and
lightning
on
the
rustling
of
sacred
trees
and
so
forth
mongoloidity
the
time
of
dependence
on
thoughts
the
christian
time
reserved
for
the
future
are
the
words
i
am
the
owner
of
the
world
of
things
i
am
the
owner
of
the
world
of
mind
in
the
negroid
age
fall
the
campaigns
of
sesostris
and
the
importance
of
egypt
and
of
northern
africa
in
general
to
the
mongoloid
age
belong
the
invasions
of
the
huns
and
mongols
up
to
the
russians
the
value
of
me
cannot
possibly
be
rated
high
so
long
as
the
hard
diamond
of
the
not
me
bears
so
enormous
a
price
as
was
the
case
both
with
god
and
with
the
world
the
not
me
is
still
too
stony
and
indomitable
to
be
consumed
and
absorbed
by
me
rather
men
only
creep
about
with
extraordinary
bustle
on
this
immovable
entity
on
this
substance
like
parasitic
animals
on
a
body
from
whose
juices
they
draw
nourishment
yet
without
consuming
it
it
is
the
bustle
of
vermin
the
assiduity
of
mongolians
among
the
chinese
we
know
everything
remains
as
it
used
to
be
and
nothing
essential
or
substantial
suffers
a
change
all
the
more
actively
do
they
work
away
at
that
which
remains
which
bears
the
name
of
the
old
ancestors
and
the
like
accordingly
in
our
mongolian
age
all
change
has
been
only
reformatory
or
ameliorative
not
destructive
or
consuming
and
annihilating
the
substance
the
object
remains
all
our
assiduity
was
only
the
activity
of
ants
and
the
hopping
of
fleas
jugglers
tricks
on
the
immovable
tight
rope
of
the
objective
corve
service
under
the
leadership
of
the
unchangeable
or
eternal
the
chinese
are
doubtless
the
most
positive
nation
because
totally
buried
in
precepts
but
neither
has
the
christian
age
come
out
from
the
positive
from
limited
freedom
freedom
within
certain
limits
in
the
most
advanced
stage
of
civilization
this
activity
earns
the
name
of
scientific
activity
of
working
on
a
motionless
presupposition
a
hypothesis
that
is
not
to
be
upset
in
its
first
and
most
unintelligible
form
morality
shows
itself
as
habit
to
act
according
to
the
habit
and
usage
mores
of
ones
country
is
to
be
moral
there
therefore
pure
moral
action
clear
unadulterated
morality
is
most
straightforwardly
practiced
in
china
they
keep
to
the
old
habit
and
usage
and
hate
each
innovation
as
a
crime
worthy
of
death
for
innovation
is
the
deadly
enemy
of
habit
of
the
old
of
permanence
in
fact
too
it
admits
of
no
doubt
that
through
habit
man
secures
himself
against
the
obtrusiveness
of
things
of
the
world
and
founds
a
world
of
his
own
in
which
alone
he
is
and
feels
at
home
builds
himself
a
heaven
why
heaven
has
no
other
meaning
than
that
it
is
mans
proper
home
in
which
nothing
alien
regulates
and
rules
him
any
longer
no
influence
of
the
earthly
any
longer
makes
him
himself
alien
in
short
in
which
the
dross
of
the
earthly
is
thrown
off
and
the
combat
against
the
world
has
found
an
end
q
in
which
therefore
nothing
is
any
longer
denied
him
heaven
is
the
end
of
abnegation
it
is
free
enjoyment
there
man
no
longer
denies
himself
anything
because
nothing
is
any
longer
alien
and
hostile
to
him
but
now
habit
is
a
second
nature
which
detaches
and
frees
man
from
his
first
and
original
natural
condition
in
securing
him
against
every
casualty
of
it
the
fully
elaborated
habit
of
the
chinese
has
provided
for
all
emergencies
and
everything
is
looked
out
for
whatever
may
come
the
chinaman
always
knows
how
he
has
to
behave
and
does
not
need
to
decide
first
according
to
the
circumstances
no
unforeseen
case
throws
him
down
from
the
heaven
of
his
rest
the
morally
habituated
and
inured
chinaman
is
not
surprised
and
taken
off
his
guard
he
behaves
with
equanamity
that
is
with
equal
spirit
or
temper
toward
everything
because
his
temper
protected
by
the
precaution
of
his
traditional
usage
does
not
lose
its
balance
hence
on
the
ladder
of
culture
or
civilization
humanity
mounts
the
first
round
through
habit
and
as
it
conceives
that
in
climbing
to
culture
it
is
at
the
same
time
climbing
to
heaven
the
realm
of
culture
or
second
nature
it
really
mounts
the
first
round
of
the
q
ladder
to
heaven
if
mongoldom
has
settled
the
existence
of
spiritual
beings
q
if
it
has
created
a
world
of
spirits
a
heaven
q
the
caucasians
have
wrestled
for
thousands
of
years
with
these
spiritual
beings
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
them
what
were
they
doing
then
but
building
on
mongolian
ground
they
have
not
built
on
sand
but
in
the
air
they
have
wrestled
with
mongolism
stormed
the
mongolian
heaven
tien
when
will
they
at
last
annihilate
this
heaven
when
will
they
at
last
become
really
caucasians
and
find
themselves
when
will
the
immortality
of
the
soul
which
in
these
latter
days
thought
it
was
giving
itself
still
more
security
if
it
presented
itself
as
immortality
of
mind
at
last
change
to
the
mortality
of
mind
it
was
when
in
the
industrious
struggle
of
the
mongolian
race
men
had
built
a
heaven
that
those
of
the
caucasian
race
since
in
their
mongolian
complexion
they
have
to
do
with
heaven
took
upon
themselves
the
opposite
task
the
task
of
storming
that
heaven
of
custom
heaven
storming
activity
to
dig
under
all
human
ordinance
in
order
to
set
up
a
new
and
q
better
one
on
the
cleared
site
to
wreck
all
customs
in
order
to
put
new
and
q
better
customs
in
their
place
q
their
act
is
limited
to
this
but
is
it
thus
already
purely
and
really
what
it
aspires
to
be
and
does
it
reach
its
final
aim
no
in
this
creation
of
a
better
it
is
tainted
with
mongolism
it
storms
heaven
only
to
make
a
heaven
again
it
overthrows
an
old
power
only
to
legitimate
a
new
power
it
only
q
improves
nevertheless
the
point
aimed
at
often
as
it
may
vanish
from
the
eyes
at
every
new
attempt
is
the
real
complete
downfall
of
heaven
customs
q
in
short
of
man
secured
only
against
the
world
of
the
isolation
or
inwardness
of
man
through
the
heaven
of
culture
man
seeks
to
isolate
himself
from
the
world
to
break
its
hostile
power
but
this
isolation
of
heaven
must
likewise
be
broken
and
the
true
end
of
heaven
storming
is
the
q
downfall
of
heaven
the
annihilation
of
heaven
improving
and
reforming
is
the
mongolism
of
the
caucasian
because
thereby
he
is
always
getting
up
again
what
already
existed
q
to
wit
a
precept
a
generality
a
heaven
he
harbours
the
most
irreconcilable
enmity
to
heaven
and
yet
builds
new
heavens
daily
piling
heaven
on
heaven
he
only
crushes
one
by
another
the
jews
heaven
destroys
the
greeks
the
christians
the
jews
the
protestants
the
catholics
q
if
the
heaven
storming
men
of
caucasian
blood
throw
off
their
mongolian
skin
they
will
bury
the
emotional
man
under
the
ruins
of
the
monstrous
world
of
emotion
the
isolated
man
under
his
isolated
world
the
paradisiacal
man
under
his
heaven
and
heaven
is
the
realm
of
spirits
the
realm
of
freedom
of
the
spirit
the
realm
of
heaven
the
realm
of
spirits
and
ghosts
has
found
its
right
standing
in
the
speculative
philosophy
here
it
was
stated
as
the
realm
of
thoughts
concepts
and
ideas
heaven
is
peopled
with
thoughts
and
ideas
and
this
realm
of
spirits
is
then
the
true
reality
to
want
to
win
freedom
for
the
spirit
is
mongolism
freedom
of
the
spirit
is
mongolian
freedom
freedom
of
feeling
moral
freedom
and
so
forth
we
may
find
the
word
morality
taken
as
synonymous
with
spontaneity
self
determination
but
that
is
not
involved
in
it
rather
has
the
caucasian
shown
himself
spontaneous
only
in
spite
of
his
mongolian
morality
the
mongolian
heaven
or
morals

remained
the
strong
castle
and
only
by
storming
incessantly
at
this
castle
did
the
caucasian
show
himself
moral
if
he
had
not
had
to
do
with
morals
at
all
any
longer
if
he
had
not
had
therein
his
indomitable
continual
enemy
the
relation
to
morals
would
cease
and
consequently
morality
would
cease
that
his
spontaneity
is
still
a
moral
spontaneity
therefore
is
just
the
mongoloidity
of
it
q
is
a
sign
that
in
it
he
has
not
arrived
at
himself
moral
spontaneity
corresponds
entirely
with
religious
and
orthodox
philosophy
constitutional
monarchy
the
christian
state
freedom
within
certain
limits
the
limited
freedom
of
the
press
or
in
a
figure
to
the
hero
fettered
to
a
sick
bed
man
has
not
really
vanquished
shamanism
and
its
spooks
till
he
possesses
the
strength
to
lay
aside
not
only
the
belief
in
ghosts
or
in
spirits
but
also
the
belief
in
the
spirit
he
who
believes
in
a
spook
no
more
assumes
the
introduction
of
a
higher
world
than
he
who
believes
in
the
spirit
and
both
seek
behind
the
sensual
world
a
supersensual
one
in
short
they
produce
and
believe
another
world
and
this
other
world
the
product
of
their
mind
is
a
spiritual
world
for
their
senses
grasp
and
know
nothing
of
another
a
non
sensual
world
only
their
spirit
lives
in
it
going
on
from
this
mongolian
belief
in
the
existence
of
spiritual
beings
to
the
point
that
the
proper
being
of
man
too
is
his
spirit
and
that
all
care
must
be
directed
to
this
alone
to
the
welfare
of
his
soul
is
not
hard
influence
on
the
spirit
so
called
moral
influence
is
hereby
assured
hence
it
is
manifest
that
mongolism
represents
utter
absence
of
any
rights
of
the
sensuous
represents
non
sensuousness
and
unnature
and
that
sin
and
the
consciousness
of
sin
was
our
mongolian
torment
that
lasted
thousands
of
years
but
who
then
will
dissolve
the
spirit
into
its
nothing
he
who
by
means
of
the
spirit
set
forth
nature
as
the
null
finite
transitory
he
alone
can
bring
down
the
spirit
too
to
like
nullity
i
can
each
one
among
you
can
who
does
his
will
as
an
absolute
i
in
a
word
the
egoist
can

before
the
sacred
people
lose
all
sense
of
power
and
all
confidence
they
occupy
a
powerless
and
humble
attitude
toward
it
and
yet
no
thing
is
sacred
of
itself
but
by
my
declaring
it
sacred
by
my
declaration
my
judgment
my
bending
the
knee
in
short
by
my
q
conscience
sacred
is
everything
which
for
the
egoist
is
to
be
unapproachable
not
to
be
touched
outside
his
power
q
above
him
sacred
in
a
word
is
every
matter
of
conscience
for
this
is
a
matter
of
conscience
to
me
means
simply
i
hold
this
sacred
for
little
children
just
as
for
animals
nothing
sacred
exists
because
in
order
to
make
room
for
this
conception
one
must
already
have
progressed
so
far
in
understanding
that
he
can
make
distinctions
like
good
and
bad
warranted
and
unwarranted
only
at
such
a
level
of
reflection
or
intelligence
q
the
proper
stand
point
of
religion
q
can
unnatural
that
is
brought
into
existence
by
thinking
reverence
sacred
dread
step
into
the
place
of
natural
fear
to
this
sacred
dread
belongs
holding
something
outside
oneself
for
mightier
greater
better
warranted
better
the
attitude
in
which
one
acknowledges
the
might
of
something
alien
q
not
merely
feels
it
then
but
expressly
acknowledges
it
admits
it
yields
surrenders
lets
himself
be
tied
devotion
humility
servility
submission
here
walks
the
whole
ghostly
troop
of
the
christian
virtues
everything
toward
which
you
cherish
any
respect
or
reverence
deserves
the
name
of
sacred
you
yourselves
too
say
that
you
would
feel
a
sacred
dread
of
laying
hands
on
it
and
you
give
this
tinge
even
to
the
unholy
gallows
crime
etc
you
have
a
horror
of
touching
it
there
lies
in
it
something
uncanny
that
is
unfamiliar
or
not
your
own
if
something
or
other
did
not
rank
as
sacred
in
a
mans
mind
why
then
all
bars
would
be
let
down
to
self
will
to
unlimited
subjectivity
fear
makes
the
beginning
and
one
can
make
himself
fearful
to
the
coarsest
man
already
therefore
a
barrier
against
his
insolence
but
in
fear
there
always
remains
the
attempt
to
liberate
oneself
from
what
is
feared
by
guile
deception
tricks
etc
in
reverence

on
the
contrary
it
is
quite
otherwise
here
something
is
not
only
feared

but
also
honoured

what
is
feared
has
become
an
inward
power
which
i
can
no
longer
get
clear
of
i
honour
it
am
captivated
by
it
and
devoted
to
it
belong
to
it
by
the
honour
which
i
pay
it
i
am
completely
in
its
power
and
do
not
even
attempt
liberation
any
longer
now
i
am
attached
to
it
with
all
the
strength
of
faith
i
believe
i
and
what
i
fear
are
one
not
i
live
but
the
respected
lives
in
me
because
the
spirit
the
infinite
does
not
allow
of
coming
to
any
end
therefore
it
is
stationary
it
fears
dying
it
cannot
let
go
its
dear
jesus
the
greatness
of
finiteness
is
no
longer
recognized
by
its
blinded
eye
the
object
of
fear
now
raised
to
veneration
may
no
longer
be
handled
reverence
is
made
eternal
the
respected
is
deified
the
man
is
now
no
longer
employed
in
creating
but
in
learning
knowing
investigating
occupied
with
a
fixed
object
losing
himself
in
its
depths
without
return
to
himself
the
relation
to
this
object
is
that
of
knowing
fathoming
basing
not
that
of
dissolution
abrogation
man
is
to
be
religious
that
is
settled
therefore
people
busy
themselves
only
with
the
question
how
this
is
to
be
attained
what
is
the
right
meaning
of
religiousness
etc
quite
otherwise
when
one
makes
the
axiom
itself
doubtful
and
calls
it
in
question
even
though
it
should
go
to
smash
morality
too
is
such
a
sacred
conception
one
must
be
moral
and
must
look
only
for
the
right
how
the
right
way
to
be
so
one
dares
not
go
at
morality
itself
with
the
question
whether
it
is
not
itself
an
illusion
it
remains
exalted
above
all
doubt
unchangeable
and
so
we
go
on
with
the
sacred
grade
after
grade
from
the
holy
to
the
holy
of
holies

men
are
sometimes
divided
into
two
classes
cultured
and
uncultured
the
former
so
far
as
they
were
worthy
of
their
name
occupied
themselves
with
thoughts
with
mind
and
because
in
the
time
since
christ
of
which
the
very
principle
is
thought
they
were
the
ruling
ones
demanded
a
servile
respect
for
the
thoughts
recognized
by
them
state
emperor
church
god
morality
order
are
such
thoughts
or
spirits
that
exist
only
for
the
mind
a
merely
living
being
an
animal
cares
as
little
for
them
as
a
child
but
the
uncultured
are
really
nothing
but
children
and
he
who
attends
only
to
the
necessities
of
his
life
is
indifferent
to
those
spirits
but
because
he
is
also
weak
before
them
he
succumbs
to
their
power
and
is
ruled
by
q
thoughts
this
is
the
meaning
of
hierarchy
hierarchy
is
dominion
of
thoughts
dominion
of
mind
we
are
hierarchic
to
this
day
kept
down
by
those
who
are
supported
by
thoughts
thoughts
are
the
sacred
but
the
two
are
always
clashing
now
one
and
now
the
other
giving
the
offence
and
this
clash
occurs
not
only
in
the
collision
of
two
men
but
in
one
and
the
same
man
for
no
cultured
man
is
so
cultured
as
not
to
find
enjoyment
in
things
too
and
so
be
uncultured
and
no
uncultured
man
is
totally
without
thoughts
in
hegel
it
comes
to
light
at
last
what
a
longing
for
things
even
the
most
cultured
man
has
and
what
a
horror
of
every
hollow
theory
he
harbours
with
him
reality
the
world
of
things
is
altogether
to
correspond
to
the
thought
and
no
concept
is
to
be
without
reality
this
caused
hegels
system
to
be
known
as
the
most
objective
as
if
in
it
thought
and
thing
celebrated
their
union
but
this
was
simply
the
extremest
case
of
violence
on
the
part
of
thought
its
highest
pitch
of
despotism
and
sole
dominion
the
triumph
of
mind
and
with
it
the
triumph
of
philosophy
philosophy
cannot
hereafter
achieve
anything
higher
for
its
highest
is
the
omnipotence
of
mind
the
almightiness
of
mind

spiritual
men
have
taken
into
their
head
something
that
is
to
be
realized
they
have
concepts
of
love
goodness
and
the
like
which
they
would
like
to
see
realized
therefore
they
want
to
set
up
a
kingdom
of
love
on
earth
in
which
no
one
any
longer
acts
from
selfishness
but
each
one
from
love
love
is
to
rule
what
they
have
taken
into
their
head
what
shall
we
call
it
but
q
fixed
idea
why
their
head
is
haunted
the
most
oppressive
spook
is
man
think
of
the
proverb
the
road
to
ruin
is
paved
with
good
intentions
the
intention
to
realize
humanity
altogether
in
oneself
to
become
altogether
man
is
of
such
ruinous
kind
here
belong
the
intentions
to
become

so

p

bruno
bauer
says
that
middle
class
which
was
to
receive
such
a
terrible
importance
for
modern
history
is
capable
of
no
self
sacrificing
action
no
enthusiasm
for
an
idea
no
exaltation
it
devotes
itself
to
nothing
but
the
interests
of
its
mediocrity
i
e
it
remains
always
limited
to
itself
and
conquers
at
last
only
through
its
bulk
with
which
it
has
succeeded
in
tiring
out
the
efforts
of
passion
enthusiasm
consistency
q
through
its
surface
into
which
it
absorbs
a
part
of
the
new
ideas
and
p

it
has
turned
the
revolutionary
ideas
for
which
not
it
but
unselfish
or
impassioned
men
sacrificed
themselves
solely
to
its
own
profit
has
turned
spirit
into
money
q
that
is
to
be
sure
after
it
had
taken
away
from
those
ideas
their
point
their
consistency
their
destructive
seriousness
fanatical
against
all
egoism
these
people
then
are
not
self
sacrificing
not
enthusiastic
not
idealistic
not
consistent
not
zealots
they
are
egoists
in
the
usual
sense
selfish
people
looking
out
for
their
advantage
sober
calculating
who
then
is
self
sacrificing

in
the
full
sense
surely
he
who
ventures
everything
else
for
one
thing
one
object
one
will
one
passion
is
not
the
lover
self
sacrificing
who
forsakes
father
and
mother
endures
all
dangers
and
privations
to
reach
his
goal
or
the
ambitious
man
who
offers
up
all
his
desires
wishes
and
satisfactions
to
the
single
passion
or
the
avaricious
man
who
denies
himself
everything
to
gather
treasures
or
the
pleasure
seeker
he
is
ruled
by
a
passion
to
which
he
brings
the
rest
as
sacrifices
and
are
these
self
sacrificing
people
perchance
not
selfish
not
egoist
as
they
have
only
one
ruling
passion
so
they
provide
for
only
one
satisfaction
but
for
this
the
more
strenuously
they
are
wholly
absorbed
in
it
their
entire
activity
is
egoistic
but
it
is
a
one
sided
unopened
narrow
egoism
it
is
possessedness
why
those
are
petty
passions
by
which
on
the
contrary
man
must
not
let
himself
be
enthralled
man
must
make
sacrifices
for
a
great
idea
a
great
cause
a
great
idea
a
good
cause
is
it
may
be
the
honour
of
god
for
which
innumerable
people
have
met
death
christianity
which
has
found
its
willing
martyrs
the
holy
catholic
church
which
has
greedily
demanded
sacrifices
of
heretics
liberty
and
equality
which
were
waited
on
by
bloody
guillotines
he
who
lives
for
a
great
idea
a
good
cause
a
doctrine
a
system
a
lofty
calling
may
not
let
any
worldly
lusts
any
self
seeking
interest
spring
up
in
him
here
we
have
the
concept
of
clericalism
or
as
it
may
also
be
called
in
its
pedagogic
activity
school
masterliness
for
the
idealists
play
the
schoolmaster
over
us
the
clergyman
is
especially
called
to
live
to
the
idea
and
to
work
for
the
idea
the
truly
good
cause
therefore
the
people
feel
how
little
it
befits
him
to
show
worldly
haughtiness
to
desire
good
living
to
join
in
such
pleasures
as
dancing
and
gaming
q
in
short
to
have
any
other
than
a
sacred
interest
hence
too
doubtless
is
derived
the
scanty
salary
of
teachers
who
are
to
feel
themselves
repaid
by
the
sacredness
of
their
calling
alone
and
to
renounce
other
enjoyments
even
a
directory
of
the
sacred
ideas
one
or
more
of
which
man
is
to
look
upon
as
his
calling
is
not
lacking
family
fatherland
science
etc
may
find
in
me
a
servant
faithful
to
his
calling
here
we
come
upon
the
old
old
craze
of
the
world
which
has
not
yet
learned
to
do
without
clericalism
q
that
to
live
and
work
for
an
idea
is
mans
calling
and
according
to
the
faithfulness
of
its
fulfilment
his
human
worth
is
measured
this
is
the
dominion
of
the
idea
in
other
words
it
is
clericalism
thus
robespierre
and
st
just
were
priests
through
and
through
inspired
by
the
idea
enthusiasts
consistent
instruments
of
this
idea
idealistic
men

so
st
just
exclaims
in
a
speech
there
is
something
terrible
in
the
sacred
love
of
country
it
is
so
exclusive
that
it
sacrifices
everything
to
the
public
interest
without
mercy
without
fear
without
human
consideration
it
hurls
manlius
down
the
precipice
it
sacrifices
its
private
inclinations
it
leads
regulus
to
carthage
throws
a
roman
into
the
chasm
and
sets
marat
as
a
victim
of
his
devotion
in
the
pantheon
now
over
against
these
representatives
of
ideal
or
sacred
interests
stands
a
world
of
innumerable
personal
profane
interests
no
idea
no
system
no
sacred
cause
is
so
great
as
never
to
be
outrivaled
and
modified
by
these
personal
interests
even
if
they
are
silent
momentarily
and
in
times
of
rage
and
fanaticism
yet
they
soon
come
uppermost
again
through
the
sound
sense
of
the
people
those
ideas
do
not
completely
conquer
till
they
are
no
longer
hostile
to
personal
interests
till
they
satisfy
egoism
the
man
who
is
just
now
crying
herrings
in
front
of
my
window
has
a
personal
interest
in
good
sales
and
if
his
wife
or
anybody
else
wishes
him
the
like
this
remains
a
personal
interest
all
the
same
if
on
the
other
hand
a
thief
deprived
him
of
his
basket
then
there
would
at
once
arise
an
interest
of
many
of
the
whole
city
of
the
whole
country
or
in
a
word
of
all
who
abhor
theft
an
interest
in
which
the
herring
sellers
person
would
become
indifferent
and
in
its
place
the
category
of
the
robbed
man
would
come
into
the
foreground
but
even
here
all
might
yet
resolve
itself
into
a
personal
interest
each
of
the
partakers
reflecting
that
he
must
concur
in
the
punishment
of
the
thief
because
unpunished
stealing
might
otherwise
become
general
and
cause
him
too
to
lose
his
own
such
a
calculation
however
can
hardly
be
assumed
on
the
part
of
many
and
we
shall
rather
hear
the
cry
that
the
thief
is
a
criminal
here
we
have
before
us
a
judgment
the
thiefs
action
receiving
its
expression
in
the
concept
crime
now
the
matter
stands
thus
even
if
a
crime
did
not
cause
the
slightest
damage
either
to
me
or
to
any
of
those
in
whom
i
take
an
interest
i
should
nevertheless
denounce
it
why
because
i
am
enthusiastic
for
morality
filled
with
the
idea
of
morality
what
is
hostile
to
it
i
everywhere
assail
because
in
his
mind
theft
ranks
as
abominable
without
any
question
proudhon
for
instance
thinks
that
with
the
sentence
property
is
theft
he
has
at
once
put
a
brand
on
property
in
the
sense
of
the
priestly
theft
is
always
a
crime
or
at
least
a
misdeed
here
the
personal
interest
is
at
an
end
this
particular
person
who
has
stolen
the
basket
is
perfectly
indifferent
to
my
person
it
is
only
the
thief
this
concept
of
which
that
person
presents
a
specimen
that
i
take
an
interest
in
the
thief
and
man
are
in
my
mind
irreconcilable
opposites
for
one
is
not
truly
man
when
one
is
a
thief
one
degrades
man
or
humanity
in
himself
when
one
steals
dropping
out
of
personal
concern
one
gets
into
philanthropy
friendliness
to
man
which
is
usually
misunderstood
as
if
it
was
a
love
to
men
to
each
individual
while
it
is
nothing
but
a
love
of
man
the
unreal
concept
the
spook
it
is
not
touz
anqrwpouz
men
but
ton
anqrwpon
man
that
the
philantropist
carries
in
his
heart
to
be
sure
he
cares
for
each
individual
but
only
because
he
wants
to
see
his
beloved
ideal
realized
everywhere
so
there
is
nothing
said
here
of
care
for
me
you
us
that
would
be
personal
interest
and
belongs
under
the
head
of
worldly
love
philanthropy
is
a
heavenly
spiritual
a
q
priestly
love
man
must
be
restored
in
us
even
if
thereby
we
poor
devils
should
come
to
grief
it
is
the
same
priestly
principle
as
that
famous
fiat
justitia
pereat
mundus
man
and
justice
are
ideas
ghosts
for
love
of
which
everything
is
sacrificed
therefore
the
priestly
spirits
are
the
self
sacrificing
ones
he
who
is
infatuated
with
man
leaves
persons
out
of
account
so
far
as
that
infatuation
extends
and
floats
in
an
ideal
sacred
interest
man
you
see
is
not
a
person
but
an
ideal
a
spook
now
things
as
different
as
possible
can
belong
to
man
and
be
so
regarded
if
one
finds
mans
chief
requirement
in
piety
there
arises
religious
clericalism
if
one
sees
it
in
morality
then
moral
clericalism
raises
its
head
on
this
account
the
priestly
spirits
of
our
day
want
to
make
a
religion
of
everything
a
religion
of
liberty
religion
of
equality
etc
and
for
them
every
idea
becomes
a
sacred
cause
even
citizenship
politics
publicity
freedom
of
the
press
trial
by
jury
now
what
does
unselfishness
mean
in
this
sense
having
only
an
ideal
interest
before
which
no
respect
of
persons
avails
the
stiff
head
of
the
worldly
man
opposes
this
but
for
centuries
has
always
been
worsted
at
least
so
far
as
to
have
to
bend
the
unruly
neck
and
honour
the
higher
power
clericalism
pressed
it
down
when
the
worldly
egoist
had
shaken
off
a
higher
power
such
as
the
old
testament
law
the
roman
pope
then
at
once
a
seven
times
higher
one
was
over
him
again
such
as
faith
in
the
place
of
the
law
the
transformation
of
all
laymen
into
divines
in
place
of
the
limited
body
of
clergy
and
so
on
his
experience
was
like
that
of
the
possessed
man
into
whom
seven
devils
passed
when
he
thought
he
had
freed
himself
from
one
in
the
passage
quoted
above
all
ideality
is
denied
to
the
middle
class
it
certainly
schemed
against
the
ideal
consistency
with
which
robespierre
wanted
to
carry
out
the
principle
the
instinct
of
its
interest
told
it
that
this
consistency
harmonized
too
little
with
what
its
mind
was
set
on
and
that
it
would
be
acting
against
itself
if
it
were
willing
to
further
the
enthusiasm
for
principle
was
it
to
behave
so
unselfishly
as
to
abandon
all
its
aims
in
order
to
bring
a
harsh
theory
to
its
triumph
it
suits
the
priests
admirably
to
be
sure
when
people
listen
to
their
summons
cast
away
everything
and
follow
me
or
sell
all
that
thou
hast
and
give
to
the
poor
and
thou
shalt
have
treasure
in
heaven
and
come
follow
me
some
decided
idealists
obey
this
call
but
most
act
like
ananias
and
sapphira
maintaining
a
behaviour
half
clerical
or
religious
and
half
worldly
serving
god
and
mammon
i
do
not
blame
the
middle
class
for
not
wanting
to
let
its
aims
be
frustrated
by
robespierre
for
inquiring
of
its
egoism
how
far
it
might
give
the
revolutionary
idea
a

those
who
let
their
own
interests
be
frustrated
by
the

of
the
middle

not
they

august
becker
says

to
win
the
producers
proletarians
a
negation
of
the
traditional
conception
of
right
is
by
no
means
enough
folks
unfortunately
care
little
for
the
theoretical
victory
of
the
idea
one
must
demonstrate
to
them
ad
oculos
how
this
victory
can
be
practically
utilized
in
life
and
p

you
must
get
hold
of
folks
by
their
real
interests
if
you
want
to
work
upon
them
immediately
after
this
he
shows
how
a
fine
looseness
of
morals
is
already
spreading
among
our
peasants
because
they
prefer
to
follow
their
real
interests
rather
than
the
commands
of
morality
because
the
revolutionary
priests
or
schoolmasters
served
man
they
cut
off
the
heads
of
men
the
revolutionary
laymen
those
outside
the
sacred
circle
did
not
feel
any
greater
horror
of
cutting
off
heads
but
were
less
anxious
about
the
rights
of
man
than
about
their
own
how
comes
it
though
that
the
egoism
of
those
who
affirm
personal
interest
and
always
inquire
of
it
is
nevertheless
forever
succumbing
to
a
priestly
or
schoolmasterly
that
is
an
ideal
interest
their
person
seems
to
them
too
small
too
insignificant
q
and
is
so
in
fact
q
to
lay
claim
to
everything
and
be
able
to
put
itself
completely
in
force
there
is
a
sure
sign
of
this
in
their
dividing
themselves
into
two
persons
an
eternal
and
a
temporal
and
always
caring
either
only
for
the
one
or
only
for
the
other
on
sunday
for
the
eternal
on
the
work
day
for
the
temporal
in
prayer
for
the
former
in
work
for
the
latter
they
have
the
priest
in
themselves
therefore
they
do
not
get
rid
of
him
but
hear
themselves
lectured
inwardly
every
sunday
how
men
have
struggled
and
calculated
to
get
at
a
solution
regarding
these
dualistic
essences
idea
followed
upon
idea
principle
upon
principle
system
upon
system
and
none
knew
how
to
keep
down
permanently
the
contradiction
of
the
worldly
man
the
so
called
egoist
does
not
this
prove
that
all
those
ideas
were
too
feeble
to
take
up
my
whole
will
into
themselves
and
satisfy
it
they
were
and
remained
hostile
to
me
even
if
the
hostility
lay
concealed
for
a
considerable
time
will
it
be
the
same
with
self
ownership
is
it
too
only
an
attempt
at
mediation
whatever
principle
i
turned
to
it
might
be
to
that
of
reason
i
always
had
to
turn
away
from
it
again
or
can
i
always
be
rational
arrange
my
life
according
to
reason
in
everything
i
can
no
doubt
strive
after
rationality
i
can
love
it
just
as
i
can
also
love
god
and
every
other
idea
i
can
be
a
philosopher
a
lover
of
wisdom
as
i
love
god
but
what
i
love
what
i
strive
for
is
only
in
my
idea
my
conception
my
thoughts
it
is
in
my
heart
my
head
it
is
in
me
like
the
heart
but
it
is
not
i
i
am
not
it
to
the
activity
of
priestly
minds
belongs
especially
what
one
often
hears
called
moral
influence
moral
influence
takes
its
start
where
humiliation
begins
yes
it
is
nothing
else
than
this
humiliation
itself
the
breaking
and
bending
of
the
temper
down
to
humility

if
i
call
to
some
one
to
run
away
when
a
rock
is
to
be
blasted
i
exert
no
moral
influence
by
this
demand
if
i
say
to
a
child
you
will
go
hungry
if
you
will
not
eat
what
is
put
on
the
table
this
is
not
moral
influence
but
if
i
say
to
it
you
will
pray
honour
your
parents
respect
the
crucifix
speak
the
truth
for
this
belongs
to
man
and
is
mans
calling
or
even
this
is
gods
will
then
moral
influence
is
complete
then
a
man
is
to
bend
before
the
calling
of
man
be
tractable
become
humble
give
up
his
will
for
an
alien
one
which
is
set
up
as
rule
and
law
he
is
to
abase
himself
before
something
higher
self
abasement
he
that
abaseth
himself
shall
be
exalted
yes
yes
children
must
early
be
made
to
practice
piety
godliness
and
propriety
a
person
of
good
breeding
is
one
into
whom
good
maxims
have
been
instilled
and
impressed
poured
in
through
a
funnel
thrashed
in
and
preached
in
if
one
shrugs
his
shoulders
at
this
at
once
the
good
wring
their
hands
despairingly
and
cry
but
for
heavens
sake
if
one
is
to
give
children
no
good
instruction
why
then
they
will
run
straight
into
the
jaws
of
sin
and
become
good
for
nothing
hoodlums

gently
you
prophets
of
evil
good
for
nothing
in
your
sense
they
certainly
will
become
but
your
sense
happens
to
be
a
very
good
for
nothing
sense
the
impudent
lads
will
no
longer
let
anything
be
whined
and
chattered
into
them
by
you
and
will
have
no
sympathy
for
all
the
follies
for
which
you
have
been
raving
and
driveling
since
the
memory
of
man
began
they
will
abolish
the
law
of
inheritance
they
will
not
be
willing
to
inherit
your
stupidities
as
you
inherited
them
from
your
fathers
they
destroy
inherited
sin

if
you
command
them
bend
before
the
most
high
they
will
answer
if
he
wants
to
bend
us
let
him
come
himself
and
do
it
we
at
least
will
not
bend
of
our
own
accord
and
if
you
threaten
them
with
his
wrath
and
his
punishment
they
will
take
it
like
being
threatened
with
the
bogieman
if
you
are
no
more
successful
in
making
them
afraid
of
ghosts
then
the
dominion
of
ghosts
is
at
an
end
and
nurses
tales
find
no
q
faith
and
is
it
not
precisely
the
liberals
again
that
press
for
good
education
and
improvement
of
the
educational
system
for
how
could
their
liberalism
their
liberty
within
the
bounds
of
law
come
about
without
discipline
even
if
they
do
not
exactly
educate
to
the
fear
of
god
yet
they
demand
the
fear
of
man
all
the
more
strictly
and
awaken
enthusiasm
for
the
truly
human
calling
by
discipline

a
long
time
passed
away
in
which
people
were
satisfied
with
the
fancy
that
they
had
the
truth
without
thinking
seriously
whether
perhaps
they
themselves
must
be
true
to
possess
the
truth
this
time
was
the
middle
ages
with
the
common
consciousness
q
the
consciousness
which
deals
with
things
that
consciousness
which
has
receptivity
only
for
things
or
for
what
is
sensuous
and
sense
moving
q
they
thought
to
grasp
what
did
not
deal
with
things
and
was
not
perceptible
by
the
senses
as
one
does
indeed
also
exert
his
eye
to
see
the
remote
or
laboriously
exercise
his
hand
till
its
fingers
have
become
dexterous
enough
to
press
the
keys
correctly
so
they
chastened
themselves
in
the
most
manifold
ways
in
order
to
become
capable
of
receiving
the
supersensual
wholly
into
themselves
but
what
they
chastened
was
after
all
only
the
sensual
man
the
common
consciousness
so
called
finite
or
objective
thought
yet
as
this
thought
this
understanding
which
luther
decries
under
the
name
of
reason
is
incapable
of
comprehending
the
divine
its
chastening
contributed
just
as
much
to
the
understanding
of
the
truth
as
if
one
exercised
the
feet
year
in
and
year
out
in
dancing
and
hoped
that
in
this
way
they
would
finally
learn
to
play
the
flute
luther
with
whom
the
so
called
middle
ages
end
was
the
first
who
understood
that
the
man
himself
must
become
other
than
he
was
if
he
wanted
to
comprehend
truth
q
must
become
as
true
as
truth
itself
only
he
who
already
has
truth
in
his
belief
only
he
who
believes
in
it
can
become
a
partaker
of
it
only
the
believer
finds
it
accessible
and
sounds
its
depths
only
that
organ
of
man
which
is
able
to
blow
can
attain
the
further
capacity
of
flute
playing
and
only
that
man
can
become
a
partaker
of
truth
who
has
the
right
organ
for
it
he
who
is
capable
of
thinking
only
what
is
sensuous
objective
pertaining
to
things
figures
to
himself
in
truth
only
what
pertains
to
things
but
truth
is
spirit
stuff
altogether
inappreciable
by
the
senses
and
therefore
only
for
the
higher
consciousness
not
for
that
which
is
earthly
minded
with
luther
accordingly
dawns
the
perception
that
truth
because
it
is
a
thought
is
only
for
the
thinking
man
and
this
is
to
say
that
man
must
henceforth
take
an
utterly
different
stand
point
to
wit
the
heavenly
believing
scientific
stand
point
or
that
of
thought
in
relation
to
its
object
the
q
thought
q
that
of
mind
in
relation
to
mind
consequently
only
the
like
apprehend
the
like
you
are
like
the
spirit
that
you
understand

because
protestantism
broke
the
medieval
hierarchy
the
opinion
could
take
root
that
hierarchy
in
general
had
been
shattered
by
it
and
it
could
be
wholly
overlooked
that
it
was
precisely
a
reformation
and
so
a
reinvigoration
of
the
antiquated
hierarchy
that
medieval
hierarchy
had
been
only
a
weakly
one
as
it
had
to
let
all
possible
barbarism
of
unsanctified
things
run
on
uncoerced
beside
it
and
it
was
the
reformation
that
first
steeled
the
power
of
hierarchy
if
bruno
bauer
thinks

as
the
reformation
was
mainly
the
abstract
rending
of
the
religious
principle
from
art
state
and
science
and
so
its
liberation
from
those
powers
with
which
it
had
joined
itself
in
the
antiquity
of
the
church
and
in
the
hierarchy
of
the
middle
ages
so
too
the
theological
and
ecclesiastical
movements
which
proceeded
from
the
reformation
are
only
the
consistent
carrying
out
of
this
abstraction
of
the
religious
principle
from
the
other
powers
of
humanity
i
regard
precisely
the
opposite
as
correct
and
think
that
the
dominion
of
spirits
or
freedom
of
mind
which
comes
to
the
same
thing
was
never
before
so
all
embracing
and
all
powerful
because
the
present
one
instead
of
rending
the
religious
principle
from
art
state
and
science
lifted
the
latter
altogether
out
of
secularity
into
the
realm
of
spirit
and
made
them
religious
luther
and
descartes
have
been
appropriately
put
side
by
side
in
their
he
who
believes
in
god
and
i
think
therefore
i
am
cogito
ergo
sum
mans
heaven
is
thought
q
mind
everything
can
be
wrested
from
him
except
thought
except
faith
particular
faith
like
faith
of
zeus
astarte
jehovah
allah
may
be
destroyed
but
faith
itself
is
indestructible
in
thought
is
freedom
what
i
need
and
what
i
hunger
for
is
no
longer
granted
to
me
by
any
grace
by
the
virgin
mary
by
intercession
of
the
saints
or
by
the
binding
and
loosing
church
but
i
procure
it
for
myself
in
short
my
being
the
sum
is
a
living
in
the
heaven
of
thought
of
mind
a
cogitare
but
i
myself
am
nothing
else
than
mind
thinking
mind
according
to
descartes
believing
mind
according
to
luther
my
body
i
am
not
my
flesh
may
suffer
from
appetites
or
pains
i
am
not
my
flesh
but
i
am
mind
only
mind
this
thought
runs
through
the
history
of
the
reformation
till
today
only
by
the
more
modern
philosophy
since
descartes
has
a
serious
effort
been
made
to
bring
christianity
to
complete
efficacy
by
exalting
the
scientific
consciousness
to
be
the
only
true
and
valid
one
hence
it
begins
with
absolute
doubt
dubitare
with
grinding
common
consciousness
to
atoms
with
turning
away
from
everything
that
mind
thought
does
not
legitimate
to
it
nature
counts
for
nothing
the
opinion
of
men
their
human
precepts
for
nothing
and
it
does
not
rest
till
it
has
brought
reason
into
everything
and
can
say
the
real
is
the
rational
and
only
the
rational
is
the
real
thus
it
has
at
last
brought
mind
reason
to
victory
and
everything
is
mind
because
everything
is
rational
because
all
nature
as
well
as
even
the
most
perverse
opinions
of
men
contains
reason
for
all
must
serve
for
the
best
that
is
lead
to
the
victory
of
reason
descartess
dubitare
contains
the
decided
statement
that
only
cogitare
thought
mind
q
is
a
complete
break
with
common
consciousness
which
ascribes
reality
to
irrational
things
only
the
rational
is
only
mind
is
this
is
the
principle
of
modern
philosophy
the
genuine
christian
principle
descartes
in
his
own
time
discriminated
the
body
sharply
from
the
mind
and
the
spirit
tis
that
builds
itself
the
body
says
goethe
but
this
philosophy
itself
christian
philosophy
still
does
not
get
rid
of
the
rational
and
therefore
inveighs
against
the
merely
subjective
against
fancies
fortuities
arbitrariness
etc
what
it
wants
is
that
the
divine
should
become
visible
in
everything
and
all
consciousness
become
a
knowing
of
the
divine
and
man
behold
god
everywhere
but
god
never
is
without
the
devil
for
this
very
reason
the
name
of
philosopher
is
not
to
be
given
to
him
who
has
indeed
open
eyes
for
the
things
of
the
world
a
clear
and
undazzled
gaze
a
correct
judgment
about
the
world
but
who
sees
in
the
world
just
the
world
in
objects
only
objects
and
in
short
everything
prosaically
as
it
is
but
he
alone
is
a
philosopher
who
sees
and
points
out
or
demonstrates
heaven
in
the
world
the
supernal
in
the
earthly
the
divine
in
the
mundane
the
former
may
be
ever
so
wise
there
is
no
getting
away
from
this
what
wise
men
see
not
by
their
wisdoms
art
is
practiced
simply
by
a
childlike
heart

it
takes
this
childlike
heart
this
eye
for
the
divine
to
make
a
philosopher
the
first
named
man
has
only
a
common
consciousness
but
he
who
knows
the
divine
and
knows
how
to
tell
it
has
a
scientific
one
on
this
ground
bacon
was
turned
out
of
the
realm
of
philosophers
and
certainly
what
is
called
english
philosophy
seems
to
have
got
no
further
than
to
the
discoveries
of
so
called
clear
heads
such
as
bacon
and
hume
the
english
did
not
know
how
to
exalt
the
simplicity
of
the
childlike
heart
to
philosophic
significance
did
not
know
how
to
make
q
philosophers
out
of
childlike
hearts
this
is
as
much
as
to
say
their
philosophy
was
not
able
to
become
theological
or
theology
and
yet
it
is
only
as
theology
that
it
can
really
live
itself
out
complete
itself
the
field
of
its
battle
to
the
death
is
in
theology
bacon
did
not
trouble
himself
about
theological
questions
and
cardinal
points
cognition

its
object
in

german
thought
seeks
more
than
that
of

to
reach
the
beginnings
and
fountain
heads
of

and
sees
no

till
it
sees

descartess
cogito
ergo

the
meaning
one
lives
only
when
one
thinks
thinking
life
is
called
intellectual
life
only
mind
lives
its

is
the
true

then
just
so
in
nature
only
the
eternal
laws
the
mind
or
the
reason
of
nature
are
its
true
life
in
man
as
in

only
the

everything
else
is
dead
to
this
abstraction
to
the

of
generalities
or
of
that
which
is
lifeless
the
history
of

had
to
come
god
who

spirit
alone
lives
nothing
lives
but
the
ghost
how
can
one
try
to
assert
of
modern
philosophy
or
modern
times
that
they
have
reached
freedom
since
they
have
not
freed
us
from
the
power
of
objectivity
or
am
i
perhaps
free
from
a
despot
when
i
am
not
afraid
of
the
personal
potentate
to
be
sure
but
of
every
infraction
of
the
loving
reverence
which
i
fancy
i
owe
him
the
case
is
the
same
with
modern
times
they
only
changed
the
existing
objects
the
real
ruler
into
conceived
objects
into
ideas
before
which
the
old
respect
not
only
was
not
lost
but
increased
in
intensity
even
if
people
snapped
their
fingers
at
god
and
the
devil
in
their
former
crass
reality
people
devoted
only
the
greater
attention
to
their
ideas
they
are
rid
of
the
evil
one
evil
is
left

the
decision
having
once
been
made
not
to
let
oneself
be
imposed
on
any
longer
by
the
extant
and
palpable
little
scruple
was
felt
about
revolting
against
the
existing
state
or
overturning
the
existing
laws
but
to
sin
against
the
idea
of
the
state
not
to
submit
to
the
idea
of
law
who
would
have
dared
that
so
one
remained
a
citizen
and
a
law
respecting
loyal
man
yes
one
seemed
to
himself
to
be
only
so
much
more
law
respecting
the
more
rationalistically
one
abrogated
the
former
defective
law
in
order
to
do
homage
to
the
spirit
of
the
law
in
all
this
the
objects
had
only
suffered
a
change
of
form
they
had
remained
in
their
preponderance
and
pre
eminence
in
short
one
was
still
involved
in
obedience
and
possessedness
lived
in
reflection
and
had
an
object
on
which
one
reflected
which
one
respected
and
before
which
one
felt
reverence
and
fear
one
had
done
nothing
but
transform
the
things
into
conceptions
of
the
things
into
thoughts
and
ideas
whereby
ones
dependence
became
all
the
more
intimate
and
indissoluble
thus
it
is
not
hard
to
emancipate
oneself
from
the
commands
of
parents
or
to
set
aside
the
admonitions
of
uncle
and
aunt
the
entreaties
of
brother
and
sister
but
the
renounced
obedience
easily
gets
into
ones
conscience
and
the
less
one
does
give
way
to
the
individual
demands
because
he
rationalistically
by
his
own
reason
recognizes
them
to
be
unreasonable
so
much
the
more
conscientiously
does
he
hold
fast
to
filial
piety
and
family
love
and
so
much
the
harder
is
it
for
him
to
forgive
himself
a
trespass
against
the
conception
which
he
has
formed
of
family
love
and
of
filial
duty
released
from
dependence
as
regards
the
existing
family
one
falls
into
the
more
binding
dependence
on
the
idea
of
the
family
one
is
ruled
by
the
spirit
of
the
family
the
family
consisting
of
john
maggie
etc
whose
dominion
has
become
powerless
is
only
internalized
being
left
as
family
in
general
to
which
one
just
applies
the
old
saying
we
must
obey
god
rather
than
man
whose
significance
here
is
this
i
cannot
to
be
sure
accommodate
myself
to
your
senseless
requirements
but
as
my
family

you
still
remain
the
object
of
my
love
and
care
for
the
family
is
a
sacred
idea
which
the
individual
must
never
offend
against
q
and
this
family
internalized
and
desensualized
into
a
thought
a
conception
now
ranks
as
the
sacred
whose
despotism
is
tenfold
more
grievous
because
it
makes
a
racket
in
my
conscience
this
despotism
is
broken
when
the
conception
family
also
becomes
a
nothing
to
me
the
christian
dicta
woman
what
have
i
to
do
with
thee

i
am
come
to
stir
up
a
man
against
his
father
and
a
daughter
against
her
mother

and
others
are
accompanied
by
something
that
refers
us
to
the
heavenly
or
true
family
and
mean
no
more
than
the
states
demand
in
case
of
a
collision
between
it
and
the
family
that
we
obey
its
commands
the
case
of
morality
is
like
that
of
the
family
many
a
man
renounces
morals
but
with
great
difficulty
the
conception
morality
morality
is
the
idea
of
morals
their
intellectual
power
their
power
over
the
conscience
on
the
other
hand
morals
are
too
material
to
rule
the
mind
and
do
not
fetter
an
intellectual
man
a
so
called
independent
a
freethinker
the
protestant
may
put
it
as
he
will
the
holy
scripture
the
word
of
god
still
remains
sacred
for
him
he
for
whom
this
is
no
longer
holy
has
ceased
to
q
be
a
protestant
but
herewith
what
is
ordained
in
it
the
public
authorities
appointed
by
god
etc
also
remain
sacred
for
him
for
him
these
things
remain
indissoluble
unapproachable
raised
above
all
doubt
and
as
doubt
which
in
practice
becomes
a
buffeting
is
what
is
most
mans
own
these
things
remain
raised
above
himself
he
who
cannot
get
away
from
them
will
q
believe
for
to
believe
in
them
is
to
be
bound
to
them
through
the
fact
that
in
protestantism
the
faith
becomes
a
more
inward
faith
the
servitude
has
also
become
a
more
inward
servitude
one
has
taken
those
sanctities
up
into
himself
entwined
them
with
all
his
thoughts
and
endeavours
made
them
a
matter
of
conscience
constructed
out
of
them
a
sacred
duty
for
himself
therefore
what
the
protestants
conscience
cannot
get
away
from
is
sacred
to
him
and
conscientiousness
most
clearly
designates
his
character
protestantism
has
actually
put
a
man
in
the
position
of
a
country
governed
by
secret
police
the
spy
and
eavesdropper
conscience
watches
over
every
motion
of
the
mind
and
all
thought
and
action
is
for
it
a
matter
of
conscience
that
is
police
business
this
tearing
apart
of
man
into
natural
impulse
and
conscience
inner
populace
and
inner
police
is
what
constitutes
the
protestant
the
reason
of
the
bible
in
place
of
the
catholic
reason
of
the
church
ranks
as
sacred
and
this
feeling
and
consciousness
that
the
word
of
the
bible
is
sacred
is
called
q
conscience
with
this
then
sacredness
is
laid
upon
ones
conscience
if
one
does
not
free
himself
from
conscience
the
consciousness
of
the
sacred
he
may
act
unconscientiously
indeed
but
never
consciencelessly
the
catholic
finds
himself
satisfied
when
he
fulfils
the
command
the
protestant
acts
according
to
his
best
judgment
and
conscience
for
the
catholic
is
only
a
layman
the
protestant
is
himself
a
clergyman

just
this
is
the
progress
of
the
reformation
period
beyond
the
middle
ages
and
at
the
same
time
its
curse
q
that
the
spiritual
became
complete
what
else
was
the
jesuit
moral
philosophy
than
a
continuation
of
the
sale
of
indulgences
only
that
the
man
who
was
relieved
of
his
burden
of
sin
now
gained
also
an
insight
into
the
remission
of
sins
and
convinced
himself
how
really
his
sin
was
taken
from
him
since
in
this
or
that
particular
case
casuists
it
was
so
clearly
no
sin
at
all
that
he
committed
the
sale
of
indulgences
had
made
all
sins
and
transgressions
permissible
and
silenced
every
movement
of
conscience
all
sensuality
might
hold
sway
if
it
was
only
purchased
from
the
church
this
favouring
of
sensuality
was
continued
by
the
jesuits
while
the
strictly
moral
dark
fanatical
repentant
contrite
praying
protestants
as
the
true
completers
of
christia
nity
to
be
sure
acknowledged
only
the
intellectual
and
spiritual
man
catholicism
especially
the
jesuits
gave
aid
to
egoism
in
this
way
found
involuntary
and
unconscious
adherents
within
protestantism
itself
and
saved
us
from
the
subversion
and
extinction
of
sensuality
nevertheless
the
protestant
spirit
spreads
its
dominion
farther
and
farther
and
as
beside
it
the
divine
the
jesuit
spirit
represents
only
the
diabolic
which
is
inseparable
from
everything
divine
the
latter
can
never
assert
itself
alone
but
must
look
on
and
see
how
in
france
for
example
the
philistinism
of
protestantism
wins
at
last
and
mind
is
on
top
protestantism
is
usually
complimented
on
having
brought
the
mundane
into
repute
again
such
as
marriage
the
state
etc
but
the
mundane
itself
as
mundane
the
secular
is
even
more
indifferent
to
it
than
to
catholicism
which
lets
the
profane
world
stand
yes
and
relishes
its
pleasures
while
the
rational
consistent
protestant
sets
about
annihilating
the
mundane
altogether
and
that
simply
by
hallowing
it
so
marriage
has
been
deprived
of
its
naturalness
by
becoming
sacred
not
in
the
sense
of
the
catholic
sacrament
where
it
only
receives
its
consecration
from
the
church
and
so
is
unholy
at
bottom
but
in
the
sense
of
being
something
sacred
in
itself
to
begin
with
a
sacred
relation
just
so
the
state
also
formerly
the
pope
gave
consecration
and
his
blessing
to
it
and
its
princes
now
the
state
is
intrinsically
sacred
majesty
is
sacred
without
needing
the
priests
blessing
the
order
of
nature
or
natural
law
was
altogether
hallowed
as
gods
ordinance
hence
it
is
said
in
the
augsburg
confession

art
ii
so
now
we
reasonably
abide
by
the
saying
as
the
jurisconsults
have
wisely
and
rightly
said
that
man
and
woman
should
be
with
each
other
is
a
natural
law
now
if
it
is
a
natural
law
then
it
is
gods
ordinance
therefore
implanted
in
nature
and
therefore
a
divine
law
also
and
is
it
anything
more
than
protestantism
brought
up
to
date
when
feuerbach
pronounces
moral
relations
sacred
not
as
gods
ordinance
indeed
but
instead
for
the
sake
of
the
spirit
that
dwells
in
them
but
marriage
as
a
free
alliance
of
love
of
course
q
is
sacred
of
itself
by
the
nature
of
the
union
that
is
formed
here
that
marriage
alone
is
a
religious
one
that
is
a
true
one
that
corresponds
to
the
essence
of
marriage
love
and
so
it
is
with
all
moral
relations
they
are
ethical
are
cultivated
with
a
moral
mind
only
where
they
rank
as
religious
of
themselves
true
friendship
is
only
where
the
limits
of
friendship
are
preserved
with
religious
conscientiousness
with
the
same
conscientiousness
with
which
the
believer
guards
the
dignity
of
his
god
friendship
is
and
must
be
sacred
for
you
and
property
and
marriage
and
the
good
of
every
man
but
sacred
in
and
of
itself

that
is
a
very
essential
consideration
in
catholicism
the
mundane
can
indeed
be
consecrated
or
hallowed
but
it
is
not
sacred
without
this
priestly
blessing
in
protestantism
on
the
contrary
mundane
relations
are
sacred
of
themselves
sacred
by
their
mere
existence
the
jesuit
maxim
the
end
hallows
the
means
corresponds
precisely
to
the
consecration
by
which
sanctity
is
bestowed
no
means
are
holy
or
unholy
in
themselves
but
their
relation
to
the
church
their
use
for
the
church
hallows
the
means
regicide
was
named
as
such
if
it
was
committed
for
the
churchs
behoof
it
could
be
certain
of
being
hallowed
by
the
church
even
if
the
hallowing
was
not
openly
pronounced
to
the
protestant
majesty
ranks
as
sacred
to
the
catholic
only
that
majesty
which
is
consecrated
by
the
pontiff
can
rank
as
such
and
it
does
rank
as
such
to
him
only
because
the
pope
even
though
it
be
without
a
special
act
confers
this
sacredness
on
it
once
for
all
if
he
retracted
his
consecration
the
king
would
be
left
only
a
man
of
the
world
or
layman
an
unconsecrated
man
to
the
catholic
if
the
protestant
seeks
to
discover
a
sacredness
in
the
sensual
itself
that
he
may
then
be
linked
only
to
what
is
holy
the
catholic
strives
rather
to
banish
the
sensual
from
himself
into
a
separate
domain
where
it
like
the
rest
of
nature
keeps
its
value
for
itself
the
catholic
church
eliminated
mundane
marriage
from
its
consecrated
order
and
withdrew
those
who
were
its
own
from
the
mundane
family
the
protestant
church
declared
marriage
and
family
ties
to
be
holy
and
therefore
not
unsuitable
for
its
clergymen
a
jesuit
may
as
a
good
catholic
hallow
everything
he
needs
only
for
example
to
say
to
himself
i
as
a
priest
am
necessary
to
the
church
but
serve
it
more
zealously
when
i
appease
my
desires
properly
consequently
i
will
seduce
this
girl
have
my
enemy
there
poisoned
etc
my
end
is
holy
because
it
is
a
priests
consequently
it
hallows
the
means
for
in
the
end
it
is
still
done
for
the
benefit
of
the
church
why
should
the
catholic
priest
shrink
from
handing
emperor
henry
vii
the
poisoned
wafer
for
the
q
churchs
welfare
the
genuinely
churchly
protestants
inveighed
against
every
innocent
pleasure
because
only
the
sacred
the
spiritual
could
be
innocent
what
they
could
not
point
out
the
holy
spirit
in
the
protestants
had
to
reject
q
dancing
the
theatre
ostentation
in
the
church
and
the
like
compared
with
this
puritanical
calvinism
lutheranism
is
again
more
on
the
religious
spiritual
track
q
is
more
radical
for
the
former
excludes
at
once
a
great
number
of
things
as
sensual
and
worldly
and
purifies
the
church
lutheranism
on
the
contrary
tries
to
bring
spirit
into
all
things
as
far
as
possible
to
recognize
the
holy
spirit
as
an
essence
in
everything
and
so
to
hallow
everything
worldly
no
one
can
forbid
a
kiss
in
honour
the
spirit
of
honour
hallows
it
hence
it
was
that
the
lutheran
hegel
he
declares
himself
such
in
some
passage
or
other
he
wants
to
remain
a
lutheran
was
completely
successful
in
carrying
the
idea
through
everything
in
everything
there
is
reason
holy
spirit
or
the
real
is
rational
for
the
real
is
in
fact
everything
as
in
each
thing
for
instance
each
lie
the
truth
can
be
detected
there
is
no
absolute
lie
no
absolute
evil
and
the
like
great
works
of
mind
were
created
almost
solely
by
protestants
as
they
alone
were
the
true
disciples
and
consummators
of
mind

how
little
man
is
able
to
control
he
must
let
the
sun
run
its
course
the
sea
roll
its
waves
the
mountains
rise
to
heaven
thus
he
stands
powerless
before
the
uncontrollable
can
he
keep
off
the
impression
that
he
is
helpless
against
this
gigantic
world
it
is
a
fixed
law
to
which
he
must
submit
it
determines
his
fate
now
what
did
pre
christian
humanity
work
toward
toward
getting
rid
of
the
irruptions
of
the
destinies
not
letting
oneself
be
vexed
by
them
the
stoics
attained
this
in
apathy
declaring
the
attacks
of
nature
indifferent
and
not
letting
themselves
be
affected
by
them
horace
utters
the
famous
nil
admirari
by
which
he
likewise
announces
the
indifference
of
the
other
the
world
it
is
not
to
influence
us
not
to
rouse
our
astonishment
and
that
impavidum
ferient
ruinae
expresses
the
very
same
imperturbability
as
ps


we
do
not
fear
though
the
earth
should
perish
in
all
this
there
is
room
made
for
the
christian
proposition
that
the
world
is
empty
for
the
christian
contempt
of
the
world
the
imperturbable
spirit
of
the
wise
man
with
which
the
old
world
worked
to
prepare
its
end
now
underwent
an
inner
perturbation
against
which
no
ataraxia
no
stoic
courage
was
able
to
protect
it
the

secured
against
all

of
the

insensible
to
its

exalted
above
its
attacks
admiring
nothing
not

by
any
downfall
of
the

foamed
over
irrepressibly
again

after
the
mechanical
shock
that

from

chemical
tensions
that

began
their
wonderful
play
in

ancient
history
ends
with
this
q
that
i
have

till
i
won
my
ownership
of

all

had

the

the

but
the

is
not

lord
of

his

he
is
not
lord
and

of

for
the
spirit
is
still
sacred
the

and
the
worldless
christian
is
not
able
to
become
godless
if
the
ancient

was
a

the

a

against

the

wisdom
of
the
ancients
is
the
science
of
the
world
all
wisdom
of
the
moderns
is
the
science
of
god
the
heathen
jews
included
got
through
with
the
world
but
now
the
thing
was
to
get
through
with
self
the
spirit
too
to
become
spiritless
or
godless
for
almost
two
thousand
years
we
have
been
working
at
subjecting
the
holy
spirit
to
ourselves
and
little
by
little
we
have
torn
off
and
trodden
under
foot
many
bits
of
sacredness
but
the
gigantic
opponent
is
constantly
rising
anew
under
a
changed
form
and
name
the
spirit
has
not
yet
lost
its
divinity
its
holiness
its
sacredness
to
be
sure
it
has
long
ceased
to
flutter
over
our
heads
as
a
dove
to
be
sure
it
no
longer
gladdens
its
saints
alone
but
lets
itself
be
caught
by
the
laity
too
but
as
spirit
of
humanity
as
spirit
of
man
it
remains
still
an
alien
spirit
to
me
or
you
still
far
from
becoming
our
unrestricted
property
which
we
dispose
of
at
our
pleasure
however
one
thing
certainly
happened
and
visibly
guided
the
progress
of
post
christian
history
this
one
thing
was
the
endeavour
to
make
the
holy
spirit
more
human
and
bring
it
nearer
to
men
or
men
to
it
through
this
it
came
about
that
at
last
it
could
be
conceived
as
the
spirit
of
humanity
and
under
different
expressions
like
idea
of
humanity
mankind
humaneness
general
philanthropy
appeared
more
attractive
more
familiar
and
more
accessible
would
not
one
think
that
now
everybody
could
possess
the
holy
spirit
take
up
into
himself
the
idea
of
humanity
bring
mankind
to
form
and
existence
in
himself
no
the
spirit
is
not
stripped
of
its
holiness
and
robbed
of
its
unapproachableness
is
not
accessible
to
us
not
our
property
for
the
spirit
of
humanity
is
not
my
spirit
my
ideal
it
may
be
and
as
a
thought
i
call
it
mine
the
thought
of
humanity
is
my
property
and
i
prove
this
sufficiently
by
propounding
it
quite
according
to
my
views
and
shaping
it
today
so
tomorrow
otherwise
we
represent
it
to
ourselves
in
the
most
manifold
ways
but
it
is
at
the
same
time
an
entail
which
i
cannot
alienate
nor
get
rid
of
among
many
transformations
the
holy
spirit
became
in
time
the
absolute
idea
which
again
in
manifold
refractions
split
into
the
different
ideas
of
philanthropy
reasonableness
civic
virtue
and
so
on
but
can
i
call
the
idea
my
property
if
it
is
the
idea
of
humanity
and
can
i
consider
the
spirit
as
vanquished
if
i
am
to
serve
it
sacrifice
myself
to
it
antiquity
at
its
close
had
gained
its
ownership
of
the
world
only
when
it
had
broken
the
worlds
overpoweringness
and
divinity
recognized
the
worlds
powerlessness
and
vanity
the
case
with
regard
to
the
spirit
corresponds
when
i
have
degraded
it
to
a
spook
and
its
control
over
me
to
a
cranky
notion
then
it
is
to
be
looked
upon
as
having
lost
its
sacredness
its
holiness
its
divinity
and
then
i
use
it
as
one
uses
nature
at
pleasure
without
scruple
the
nature
of
the
case
the
concept
of
the
relationship
is
to
guide
me
in
dealing
with
the
case
or
in
contracting
the
reiation
as
if
a
concept
of
the
case
existed
on
its
own
account
and
was
not
rather
the
concept
that
one
forms
of
the
case
as
if
a
relation
which
we
enter
into
was
not
by
the
uniqueness
of
those
who
enter
into
it
itself
unique
as
if
it
depended
on
how
others
stamp
it
but
as
people
separated
the
essence
of
man
from
the
real
man
and
judged
the
latter
by
the
former
so
they
also
separate
his
action
from
him
and
appraise
it
by
human
value
concepts
are
to
decide
everywhere
concepts
to
regulate
life
concepts
to
rule
this
is
the
religious
world
to
which
hegel
gave
a
systematic
expression
bringing
method
into
the
nonsense
and
completing
the
conceptual
precepts
into
a
rounded
firmly
based
dogmatic
everything
is
sung
according
to
concepts
and
the
real
man
i
am
compelled
to
live
according
to
these
conceptual
laws
can
there
be
a
more
grievous
dominion
of
law
and
did
not
christianity
confess
at
the
very
beginning
that
it
meant
only
to
draw
judaisms
dominion
of
law
tighter
not
a
letter
of
the
law
shall
be
lost
liberalism
simply
brought
other
concepts
on
the
carpet
human
instead
of
divine
political
instead
of
ecclesiastical
scientific
instead
of
doctrinal
or
more
generally
real
concepts
and
eternal
laws
instead
of
crude
dogmas
and
precepts
now
nothing
but
mind
rules
in
the
world
an
innumerable
multitude
of
concepts
buzz
about
in
peoples
heads
and
what
are
those
doing
who
endeavour
to
get
further
they
are
negating
these
concepts
to
put
new
ones
in
their
place
they
are
saying
you
form
a
false
concept
of
right
of
the
state
of
man
of
liberty
of
truth
of
marriage
the
concept
of
right
etc
is
rather
that
one
which
we
now
set
up
thus
the
confusion
of
concepts
moves
forward
the
history
of
the
world
has
dealt
cruelly
with
us
and
the
spirit
has
obtained
an
almighty
power
you
must
have
regard
for
my
miserable
shoes
which
could
protect
your
naked
foot
my
salt
by
which
your
potatoes
would
become
palatable
and
my
state
carriage
whose
possession
would
relieve
you
of
all
need
at
once
you
must
not
reach
out
after
them
man
is
to
recognize
the
independence
of
all
these
and
innumerable
other
things
they
are
to
rank
in
his
mind
as
something
that
cannot
be
seized
or
approached
are
to
be
kept
away
from
him
he
must
have
regard
for
it
respect
it
woe
to
him
if
he
stretches
out
his
fingers
desirously
we
call
that
being
light
fingered
how
beggarly
little
is
left
us
yes
how
really
nothing
everything
has
been
removed
we
must
not
venture
on
anything
unless
it
is
given
us
we
continue
to
live
only
by
the
grace
of
the
giver
you
must
not
pick
up
a
pin
unless
indeed
you
have
got
leave
to
do
so
and
got
it
from
whom
from
respect
only
when
this
lets
you
have
it
as
property
only
when
you
can
respect
it
as
property
only
then
may
you
take
it
and
again
you
are
not
to
conceive
a
thought
speak
a
syllable
commit
an
action
that
should
have
their
warrant
in
you
alone
instead
of
receiving
it
from
morality
or
reason
or
humanity
happy
unconstraint
of
the
desirous
man
how
mercilessly
people
have
tried
to
slay
you
on
the
altar
of
constraint
but
around
the
altar
rise
the
arches
of
a
church
and
its
walls
keep
moving
further
and
further
out
what
they
enclose
is
sacred
you
can
no
longer
get
to
it
no
longer
touch
it
shrieking
with
the
hunger
that
devours
you
you
wander
round
about
these
walls
in
search
of
the
little
that
is
profane
and
the
circles
of
your
course
keep
growing
more
and
more
extended
soon
that
church
will
embrace
the
whole
world
and
you
be
driven
out
to
the
extreme
edge
another
step
and
the
world
of
the
sacred
has
conquered
you
sink
into
the
abyss
therefore
take
courage
while
it
is
yet
time
wander
about
no
longer
in
the
profane
where
now
it
is
dry
feeding
dare
the
leap
and
rush
in
through
the
gates
into
the
sanctuary
itself
if
you
devour
the
sacred
you
have
made
it
your
own
digest
the
sacramental
wafer
and
you
are
rid
of
it
c
the
free
the
ancients
and
the
moderns
having
been
presented
above
in
two
divisions
it
may
seem
as
if
the
free
were
here
to
be
described
in
a
third
division
as
independent
and
distinct
this
is
not
so
the
free
are
only
the
more
modern
and
most
modern
among
the
moderns
and
are
put
in
a
separate
division
merely
because
they
belong
to
the
present
and
what
is
present
above
all
claims
our
attention
here
i
give
the
free
only
as
a
translation
of
the
liberals
but
must
with
regard
to
the
concept
of
freedom
as
in
general
with
regard
to
so
many
other
things
whose
anticipatory
introduction
cannot
be
avoided
refer
to
what
comes
later

political
liberalism
after
the
chalice
of
so
called
absolute
monarchy
had
been
drained
down
to
the
dregs
in
the
eighteenth
century
people
became
aware
that
their
drink
did
not
taste
human
q
too
clearly
aware
not
to
begin
to
crave
a
different
cup
since
our
fathers
were
human
beings
after
all
they
at
last
desired
also
to
be
regarded
as
such
whoever
sees
in
us
something
else
than
human
beings
in
him
we
likewise
will
not
see
a
human
being
but
an
inhuman
being
and
will
meet
him
as
an
unhuman
being
on
the
other
hand
whoever
recognizes
us
as
human
beings
and
protects
us
against
the
danger
of
being
treated
inhumanly
him
we
will
honour
as
our
true
protector
and
guardian
let
us
then
hold
together
and
protect
the
man
in
each
other
then
we
find
the
necessary
protection
in
our
holding
together
and
in
ourselves
those
who
hold
together
a
fellowship
of
those
who
know
their
human
dignity
and
hold
together
as
human
beings
our
holding
together
is
the
state
we
who
hold
together
are
the
nation
in
our
being
together
as
nation
or
state
we
are
only
human
beings
how
we
deport
ourselves
in
other
respects
as
individuals
and
what
self
seeking
impulses
we
may
there
succumb
to
belongs
solely
to
our
private
life
our
public
or
state
life
is
a
purely
human
one
everything
un
human
or
egoistic
that
clings
to
us
is
degraded
to
a
private
matter
and
we
distinguish
the
state
definitely
from
civil
society
which
is
the
sphere
of
egoisms
activity
the
true
man
is
the
nation
but
the
individual
is
always
an
egoist
therefore
strip
off
your
individuality
or
isolation
wherein
dwells
discord
and
egoistic
inequality
and
consecrate
yourselves
wholly
to
the
true
man
q
the
nation
or
the
state
then
you
will
rank
as
men
and
have
all
that
is
mans
the
state
the
true
man
will
entitle
you
to
what
belongs
to
it
and
give
you
the
rights
of
man
man
gives
you
his
rights
so
runs
the
speech
of
the
commonalty
the
commonalty
is
nothing
else
than
the
thought
that
the
state
is
all
in
all
the
true
man
and
that
the
individuals
human
value
consists
in
being
a
citizen
of
the
state
in
being
a
good
citizen
he
seeks
his
highest
honour
beyond
that
he
knows
nothing
higher
than
at
most
the
antiquated
q
being
a
good
christian
the
commonalty
developed
itself
in
the
struggle
against
the
privileged
classes
by
whom
it
was
cavalierly
treated
as
third
estate
and
confounded
with
the
canaille
in
other
words
up
to
this
time
the
state
had
recognized
caste

the
son
of
a
nobleman
was
selected
for
posts
to
which
the
most
distinguished
commononers
aspired
in
vain
the
civic
feeling
revolted
against
this
no
more
distinction
no
giving
preference
to
persons
no
difference
of
classes
let
all
be
alike
no
separate
interest
is
to
be
pursued
longer
but
the
general
interest
of
all
the
state
is
to
be
a
fellows
hip
of
free
and
equal
men
and
every
one
is
to
devote
himself
to
the
welfare
of
the
whole
to
be
dissolved
in
the
state
to
make
the
state
his
end
and
ideal
state
state
so
ran
the
general
cry
and
thenceforth
people
sought
for
the
right
form
of
state
the
best
constitution
and
so
the
state
in
its
best
conception
the
thought
of
the
state
passed
into
all
hearts
and
awakened
enthusiasm
to
serve
it
this
mundane
god
became
the
new
divine
service
and
worship
the
properly
political
epoch
had
dawned
to
serve
the
state
or
the
nation
became
the
highest
ideal
the
states
interest
the
highest
interest
state
service
for
which
one
does
not
by
any
means
need
to
be
an
official
the
highest
honour
so
then
the
separate
interests
and
personalities
had
been
scared
away
and
sacrifice
for
the
state
had
become
the
shibboleth
one
must
give
up
himself
and
live
only
for
the
state
one
must
act
disinterestedly
not
want
to
benefit
himself
but
the
state
hereby
the
latter
has
become
the
true
person
before
whom
the
individual
personality
vanishes
not
i
live
but
it
lives
in
me
therefore
in
comparison
with
the
former
self
seeking
this
was
unselfishness
and
impersonality
itself
before
this
god
q
state
q
all
egoism
vanished
and
before
it
all
were
equal
they
were
without
any
other
distinction
q
men
nothing
but
men
the
revolution
took
fire
from
the
inflammable
material
of
property
the
government
needed
money
now
it
must
prove
the
proposition
that
it
is
absolute
and
so
master
of
all
property
sole
proprietor
it
must
take
to
itself
its
money
which
was
only
in
the
possession
of
the
subjects
not
their
property
instead
of
this
it
calls
states
general
to
have
this
money
granted
to
it
the
shrinking
from
strictly
logical
action
destroyed
the
illusion
of
an
absolute
government
he
who
must
have
something
granted
to
him
cannot
be
regarded
as
absolute
the
subjects
recognized
that
they
were
real
proprietors
and
that
it
was
their
money
that
was
demanded
those
who
had
hitherto
been
subjects
attained
the
consciousness
that
they
were
proprietors
bailly
depicts
this
in
a
few
words
if
you
cannot
dispose
of
my
property
without
my
assent
how
much
less
can
you
of
my
person
of
all
that
concerns
my
mental
and
social
position
all
this
is
my
property
like
the
piece
of
land
that
i
till
and
i
have
a
right
an
interest
to
make
the
laws
myself
baillys
words
sound
certainly
as
if
every
one
was
a
proprietor
now
however
instead
of
the
government
instead
of
the
prince
the
q
nation
now
became
proprietor
and
master
from
this
time
on
the
ideal
is
spoken
of
as
q
popular
liberty
q
a
free
people
etc
as
early
as
july


the
declaration
of
the
bishop
of
autun
and
barrere
took
away
all
semblance
of
the
importance
of
each
and
every
individual
in
legislation
it
showed
the
complete
powerlessness
of
the
constituents
the
majority
of
the
representatives
has
become
master
when
on
july

the
plan
for
division
of
the
work
on
the
constitution
is
proposed
mirabeau
remarks
that
the
government
has
only
power
no
rights
only
in
the
people
is
the
source
of
all
right
to
be
found
on
july

this
same
mirabeau
exclaims
is
not
the
people
the
source
of
all
power
the
source
therefore
of
all
right
and
the
source
of
all
q
power

by
the
way
here
the
substance
of
right
becomes
visible
it
is
q
power
he
who
has
power
has
right
the
commonalty
is
the
heir
of
the
privileged
classes
in
fact
the
rights
of
the
barons
which
were
taken
from
them
as
usurpations
only
passed
over
to
the
commonalty
for
the
commonalty
was
now
called
the
nation
into
the
hands
of
the
nation
all
prerogatives
were
given
back
thereby
they
ceased
to
be
prerogatives

they
became
rights

from
this
time
on
the
nation
demands
tithes
compulsory
services
it
has
inherited
the
lords
court
the
rights
of
vert
and
venison
the
q
serfs
the
night
of
august

was
the
death
night
of
privileges
or
prerogatives
cities
communes
boards
of
magistrates
were
also
privileged
furnished
with
prerogatives
and
seigniorial
rights
and
ended
with
the
new
morning
of
right
the
rights
of
the
state
the
rights
of
the
nation
the
monarch
in
the
person
of
the
royal
master
had
been
a
paltry
monarch
compared
with
this
new
monarch
the
sovereign
nation
this
monarchy
was
a
thousand
times
severer
stricter
and
more
consistent
against
the
new
monarch
there
was
no
longer
any
right
any
privilege
at
all
how
limited
the
absolute
king
of
the
ancien
regime
looks
in
comparison
the
revolution
effected
the
transformation
of
limited
monarchy
into
absolute
monarchy
from
this
time
on
every
right
that
is
not
conferred
by
this
monarch
is
an
assumption
but
every
prerogative
that
he
bestows
a
right
the
times
demanded
absolute
royalty
absolute
monarchy
therefore
down
fell
that
so
called
absolute
royalty
which
had
so
little
understood
how
to
become
absolute
that
it
remained
limited
by
a
thousand
little
lords
what
was
longed
for
and
striven
for
through
thousands
of
years
q
to
wit
to
find
that
absolute
lord
beside
whom
no
other
lords
and
lordlings
any
longer
exist
to
clip
his
power
q
the
bourgeoisie
has
brought
to
pass
it
has
revealed
the
lord
who
alone
confers
rightful
titles
and
without
whose
warrant
nothing
is
justified
so
now
we
know
that
an
idol
is
nothing
in
the
world
and
that
there
is
no
other
god
save
the
one

against
right
one
can
no
longer
as
against
a
right
come
forward
with
the
assertion
that
it
is
a
wrong
one
can
say
now
only
that
it
is
a
piece
of
nonsense
an
illusion
if
one
called
it
wrong
one
would
have
to
set
up
another
right
in
opposition
to
it
and
measure
it
by
this
if
on
the
contrary
one
rejects
right
as
such
right
in
and
of
itself
altogether
then
one
also
rejects
the
concept
of
wrong
and
dissolves
the
whole
concept
of
right
to
which
the
concept
of
wrong
belongs
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
doctrine
that
we
all
enjoy
equality
of
political
rights
only
this
q
that
the
state
has
no
regard
for
my
person
that
to
it
i
like
every
other
am
only
a
man
without
having
another
significance
that
commands
its
deference
i
do
not
command
its
deference
as
an
aristocrat
a
noblemans
son
or
even
as
heir
of
an
official
whose
office
belongs
to
me
by
inheritance
as
in
the
middle
ages
countships
etc
and
later
under
absolute
royalty
where
hereditary
offices
occur
now
the
state
has
an
innumerable
multitude
of
rights
to
give
away
the
right
to
lead
a
battalion
a
company
etc
the
right
to
lecture
at
a
university
and
so
forth
it
has
them
to
give
away
because
they
are
its
own
namely
state
rights
or
political
rights
withal
it
makes
no
difference
to
it
to
whom
it
gives
them
if
the
receiver
only
fulfils
the
duties
that
spring
from
the
delegated
rights
to
it
we
are
all
of
us
all
right
and
q
equal
q
one
worth
no
more
and
no
less
than
another
it
is
indifferent
to
me
who
receives
the
command
of
the
army
says
the
sovereign
state
provided
the
grantee
understands
the
matter
properly
equality
of
political
rights
has
consequently
the
meaning
that
every
one
may
acquire
every
right
that
the
state
has
to
give
away
if
only
he
fulfils
the
conditions
annexed
thereto
q
conditions
which
are
to
be
sought
only
in
the
nature
of
the
particular
right
not
in
a
predilection
for
the
person
persona
grata
the
nature
of
the
right
to
become
an
officer
brings
with
it
the
necessity
that
one
possess
sound
limbs
and
a
suitable
measure
of
knowledge
but
it
does
not
have
noble
birth
as
a
condition
if
on
the
other
hand
even
the
most
deserving
commoner
could
not
reach
that
station
then
an
inequality
of
political
rights
would
exist
among
the
states
of
today
one
has
carried
out
that
maxim
of
equality
more
another
less
the
monarchy
of
estates
so
i
will
call
absolute
royalty
the
time
of
the
kings
before
the
revolution
kept
the
individual
in
dependence
on
a
lot
of
little
monarchies
these
were
fellowships
societies
like
the
guilds
the
nobility
the
priesthood
the
burgher
class
cities
communes
everywhere
the
individual
must
regard
himself
first
as
a
member
of
this
little
society
and
yield
unconditional
obedience
to
its
spirit
the
esprit
de
corps
as
his
monarch
more
than
the
individual
nobleman
himself
must
his
family
the
honour
of
his
race
be
to
him
only
by
means
of
his
corporation
his
estate
did
the
individual
have
relation
to
the
greater
corporation
the
state
q
as
in
catholicism
the
individual
deals
with
god
only
through
the
priest
to
this
the
third
estate
now
showing
courage
to
negate
itself
as
an
estate
made
an
end
it
decided
no
longer
to
be
and
be
called
an
estate
beside
other
estates
but
to
glorify
and
generalize
itself
into
the
nation
hereby
it
created
a
much
more
complete
and
absolute
monarchy

and
the
entire
previously
ruling
principle
of
estates
the
principle
of
little
monarchies
inside
the
great
went
down
therefore
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
revolution
was
a
revolution
against
the
first
two
privileged
estates
it
was
against
the
little
monarchies
of
estates
in
general
but
if
the
estates
and
their
despotism
were
broken
the
king
too
we
know
was
only
a
king
of
estates
not
a
citizen
king
the
individuals
freed
from
the
inequality
of
estate
were
left
were
they
now
really
to
be
without
estate
and
out
of
gear
no
longer
bound
by
any
estate
without
a
general
bond
of
union
no
for
the
third
estate
had
declared
itself
the
nation
only
in
order
not
to
remain
an
estate
beside
other
estates
but
to
become
the
sole
estate
this
sole
estate
is
the
nation
the
state
what
had
the
individual
now
become
a
political
protestant
for
he
had
come
into
immediate
connection
with
his
god
the
state
he
was
no
longer
as
an
aristocrat
in
the
monarchy
of
the
nobility
as
a
mechanic
in
the
monarchy
of
the
guild
but
he
like
all
recognized
and
acknowledged
only
q
one
lord
the
state
as
whose
servants
they
all
received
the
equal
title
of
honour
citizen
the
bourgeoisie
is
the
aristocracy
of
desert
its
motto
let
desert
wear
its
crowns
it
fought
against
the
lazy
aristocracy
for
according
to
it
the
industrious
aristocracy
acquired
by
industry
and
desert
it
is
not
the
born
who
is
free
nor
yet
i
who
am
free
either
but
the
deserving
man
the
honest
servant
of
his
king
of
the
state
of
the
people
in
constitutional
states
through
service
one
acquires
freedom
that
is
acquires
deserts
even
if
one
served
q
mammon
one
must
deserve
well
of
the
state
of
the
principle
of
the
state
of
its
moral
spirit
he
who
serves
this
spirit
of
the
state
is
a
good
citizen
let
him
live
to
whatever
honest
branch
of
industry
he
will
in
its
eyes
innovators
practice
a
breadless
art
only
the
shopkeeper
is
practical
and
the
spirit
that
chases
after
public
offices
is
as
much
the
shopkeeping
spirit
as
is
that
which
tries
in
trade
to
feather
its
nest
or
otherwise
to
become
useful
to
itself
and
anybody
else
but
if
the
deserving
count
as
the
free
for
what
does
the
comfortable
commoner
the
faithful
office
holder
lack
of
that
freedom
that
his
heart
desires
then
the
servants
are
the
q
free
the
obedient
servant
is
the
free
man
what
glaring
nonsense
yet
this
is
the
sense
of
the
bourgeoisie
and
its
poet
goethe
as
well
as
its
philosopher
hegel
succeeded
in
glorifying
the
dependence
of
the
subject
on
the
object
obedience
to
the
objective
world
he
who
only
serves
the
cause
devotes
himself
entirely
to
it
has
the
true
freedom
and
among
thinkers
the
cause
was
q
reason
that
which
like
state
and
church
gives
q
general
laws
and
puts
the
individual
man
in
irons
by
the
thought
of
humanity
it
determines
what
is
true
according
to
which
one
must
then
act
no
more
rational
people
than
the
honest
servants
who
primarily
are
called
good
citizens
as
servants
of
the
state
be
rich
as
croesus
or
poor
as
job
q
the
state
of
the
commonalty
leaves
that
to
your
option
but
only
have
a
good
disposition
this
it
demands
of
you
and
counts
it
its
most
urgent
task
to
establish
this
in
all
therefore
it
will
keep
you
from
evil
promptings
holding
the
ill
disposed
in
check
and
silencing
their
inflammatory
discourses
under
censors
canceling
marks
or
press
penalties
and
behind
dungeon
walls
and
will
on
the
other
hand
appoint
people
of
good
disposition
as
censors
and
in
every
way
have
a
moral
influence
exerted
on
you
by
well
disposed
and
well
meaning
people
if
it
has
made
you
deaf
to
evil
promptings
then
it
opens
your
ears
again
all
the
more
diligently
to
good
promptings
with
the
time
of
the
bourgeoisie
begins
that
of
liberalism
people
want
to
see
what
is
rational
suited
to
the
times
etc
established
everywhere
the
following
definition
of
liberalism
which
is
supposed
to
be
pronounced
in
its
honour
characterizes
it
completely
liberalism
is
nothing
else
than
the
knowledge
of
reason
applied
to
our
existing
relations

its
aim
is
a
rational
order
a
moral
behaviour
a
limited
freedom
not
anarchy
lawlessness
selfhood
but
if
reason
rules
then
the
person
succumbs
art
has
for
a
long
time
not
only
acknowledged
the
ugly
but
considered
the
ugly
as
necessary
to
its
existence
and
takes
it
up
into
itself
it
needs
the
villain
in
the
religious
domain
too
the
extremest
liberals
go
so
far
that
they
want
to
see
the
most
religious
man
regarded
as
a
citizen
q
that
is
the
religious
villain
they
want
to
see
no
more
of
trials
for
heresy
but
against
the
rational
law
no
one
is
to
rebel
otherwise
he
is
threatened
with
the
severest
penalty
what
is
wanted
is
not
free
movement
and
realization
of
the
person
or
of
me
but
of
reason
a
dominion
of
reason
a
dominion
the
liberals
are
zealots
not
exactly
for
the
faith
for
god
but
certainly
for
reason
their
master
they
brook
no
lack
of
breeding
and
therefore
no
self
development
and
self
determination
they
play
the
guardian
as
effectively
as
the
most
absolute
rulers
political
liberty
what
are
we
to
understand
by
that
perhaps
the
individuals
independence
of
the
state
and
its
laws
no
on
the
contrary
the
individuals
subjection
in
the
state
and
to
the
states
laws
but
why
liberty
because
one
is
no
longer
separated
from
the
state
by
intermediaries
but
stands
in
direct
and
immediate
relation
to
it
because
one
is
a
q
citizen
not
the
subject
of
another
not
even
of
the
king
as
a
person
but
only
in
his
quality
as
supreme
head
of
the
state
political
liberty
this
fundamental
doctrine
of
liberalism
is
nothing
but
a
second
phase
of
q
protestantism
and
runs
quite
parallel
with
religious
liberty

or
would
it
perhaps
be
right
to
understand
by
the
latter
an
independence
of
religion
anything
but
that
independence
of
intermediaries
is
all
that
it
is
intended
to
express
independence
of
mediating
priests
the
abolition
of
the
laity
and
so
direct
and
immediate
relation
to
religion
or
to
god
only
on
the
supposition
that
one
has
religion
can
he
enjoy
freedom
of
religion
freedom
of
religion
does
not
mean
being
without
religion
but
inwardness
of
faith
unmediated
intercourse
with
god
to
him
who
is
religiously
free
religion
is
an
affair
of
the
heart
it
is
to
him
his
own
affair
it
is
to
him
a
sacredly
serious
matter
so
too
to
the
politically
free
man
the
state
is
a
sacredly
serious
matter
it
is
his
hearts
affair
his
chief
affair
his
own
affair
political
liberty
means
that
the
polis
the
state
is
free
freedom
of
religion
that
religion
is
free
as
freedom
of
conscience
signifies
that
conscience
is
free
not
therefore
that
i
am
free
from
the
state
from
religion
from
conscience
or
that
i
am
rid
of
them
it
does
not
mean
my
liberty
but
the
liberty
of
a
power
that
rules
and
subjugates
me
it
means
that
one
of
my
despots
like
state
religion
conscience
is
free
state
religion
conscience
these
despots
make
me
a
slave
and
their
liberty
is
my
slavery
that
in
this
they
necessarily
follow
the
principle
the
end
hallows
the
means
is
self
evident
if
the
welfare
of
the
state
is
the
end
war
is
a
hallowed
means
if
justice
is
the
states
end
homicide
is
a
hallowed
means
and
is
called
by
its
sacred
name
execution
the
sacred
state
hallows
everything
that
is
serviceable
to
it
individual
liberty
over
which
civic
liberalism
keeps
jealous
watch
does
not
by
any
means
signify
a
completely
free
self
determination
by
which
actions
become
altogether
mine
but
only
independence
of
persons
individually
free
is
he
who
is
responsible
to
no
man
taken
in
this
sense
q
and
we
are
not
allowed
to
understand
it
otherwise
q
not
only
the
ruler
is
individually
free
irresponsible
toward
men
before
god
we
know
he
acknowledges
himself
responsible
but
all
who
are
responsible
only
to
the
law
this
kind
of
liberty
was
won
through
the
revolutionary
movement
of
the
century
q
to
wit
independence
of
arbitrary
will
or
tel
est
notre
plaisir
hence
the
constitutional
prince
must
himself
be
stripped
of
all
personality
deprived
of
all
individual
decision
that
he
may
not
as
a
person
as
an
individual
man
violate
the
individual
liberty
of
others
the
personal
will
of
the
ruler
has
disappeared
in
the
constitutional
prince
it
is
with
a
right
feeling
therefore
that
absolute
princes
resist
this
nevertheless
these
very
ones
profess
to
be
in
the
best
sense
christian
princes
for
this
however
they
must
become
a
purely
spiritual
power
as
the
christian
is
subject
only
to
spirit
god
is
spirit
the
purely
spiritual
power
is
consistently
represented
only
by
the
constitutional
prince
he
who
without
any
personal
significance
stands
there
spiritualized
to
the
degree
that
he
can
rank
as
a
sheer
uncanny
spirit
as
an
idea
the
constitutional
king
is
the
truly
christian
king
the
genuine
consistent
carrying
out
of
the
christian
principle
in
the
constitutional
monarchy
individual
dominion
q
a
real
ruler
that
wills
q
has
found
its
end
here
therefore
individual
liberty
prevails
independence
of
every
individual
dictator
of
everyone
who
could
dictate
to
me
with
a
tel
est
notre
plaisir
it
is
the
completed
christian
state
life
a
spiritualized
life
the
behaviour
of
the
commonalty
is
liberal
through
and
through
every
personal
invasion
of
anothers
sphere
revolts
the
civic
sense
if
the
citizen
sees
that
one
is
dependent
on
the
humour
the
pleasure
the
will
of
a
man
as
individual
not
as
authorized
by
a
higher
power
at
once
he
brings
his
liberalism
to
the
front
and
shrieks
about
arbitrariness
in
fine
the
citizen
asserts
his
freedom
from
what
is
called
orders
ordonnance
no
one
has
any
business
to
give
me
q
orders
orders
carries
the
idea
that
what
i
am
to
do
is
another
mans
will
while
law
does
not
express
a
personal
authority
of
another
the
liberty
of
the
commonalty
is
liberty
or
independence
from
the
will
of
another
person
so
called
personal
or
individual
liberty
for
being
personally
free
means
being
only
so
free
that
no
other
person
can
dispose
of
mine
or
that
what
i
may
or
may
not
do
does
not
depend
on
the
personal
decree
of
another
the
liberty
of
the
press
for
instance
is
such
a
liberty
of
liberalism
liberalism
fighting
only
against
the
coercion
of
the
censorship
as
that
of
personal
wilfulness
but
otherwise
showing
itself
extremely
inclined
and
willing
to
tyrannize
over
the
press
by
press
laws
the
civic
liberals
want
liberty
of
writing
for
themselves
for
as
they
are
law
abiding
their
writings
will
not
bring
them
under
the
law
only
liberal
matter
only
lawful
matter
is
to
be
allowed
to
be
printed
otherwise
the
press
laws
threaten
press
penalties
if
one
sees
personal
liberty
assured
one
does
not
notice
at
all
how
if
a
new
issue
happens
to
arise
the
most
glaring
unfreedom
becomes
dominant
for
one
is
rid
of
orders
indeed
and
no
one
has
any
business
to
give
us
orders
but
one
has
become
so
much
the
more
submissive
to
the
q
law
one
is
enthralled
now
in
due
legal
form
in
the
citizen
state
there
are
only
free
people
who
are
compelled
to
thousands
of
things
to
deference
to
a
confession
of
faith
and
the
like
but
what
does
that
amount
to
why
it
is
only
the
q
state
the
law
not
any
man
that
compels
them
what
does
the
commonalty
mean
by
inveighing
against
every
personal
order
every
order
not
founded
on
the
cause
on
reason
it
is
simply
fighting
in
the
interest
of
the
cause
against
the
dominion
of
persons
but
the
minds
cause
is
the
rational
good
lawful
etc
that
is
the
good
cause
the
commonalty
wants
an
impersonal
ruler
furthermore
if
the
principle
is
this
that
only
the
cause
is
to
rule
man
q
to
wit
the
cause
of
morality
the
cause
of
legality
and
so
on
then
no
personal
balking
of
one
by
the
other
may
be
authorized
either
as
formerly
the
commoner
was
balked
of
the
aristocratic
offices
the
aristocrat
of
common
mechanical
trades
etc
free
competition
must
exist
only
through
the
thing
can
one
balk
another
as
the
rich
man
balking
the
impecunious
man
by
money
a
thing
not
as
a
person
henceforth
only
one
lordship
the
lordship
of
the
state
is
admitted
personally
no
one
is
any
longer
lord
of
another
even
at
birth
the
children
belong
to
the
state
and
to
the
parents
only
in
the
name
of
the
state
which
does
not
allow
infanticide
demands
their
baptism
and
so
on
but
all
the
states
children
furthermore
are
of
quite
equal
account
in
its
eyes
civic
or
political
equality
and
they
may
see
to
it
themselves
how
they
get
along
with
each
other
they
may
compete
free
competition
means
nothing
else
than
that
every
one
can
present
himself
assert
himself
fight
against
another
of
course
the
feudal
party
set
itself
against
this
as
its
existence
depended
on
an
absence
of
competition
the
contests
in
the
time
of
the
restoration
in
france
had
no
other
substance
than
this
q
that
the
bourgeoisie
was
struggling
for
free
competition
and
the
feudalists
were
seeking
to
bring
back
the
guild
system
now
free
competition
has
won
and
against
the
guild
system
it
had
to
win
see
below
for
the
further
discussion
if
the
revolution
ended
in
a
reaction
this
only
showed
what
the
revolution
really
was
for
every
effort
arrives
at
reaction
when
it
comes
to
discreet
reflection
and
storms
forward
in
the
original
action
only
so
long
as
it
is
an
intoxication
an
indiscretion
discretion
will
always
be
the
cue
of
the
reaction
because
discretion
sets
limits
and
liberates
what
was
really
wanted
that
is
the
principle
from
the
initial
unbridledness
and
unrestrainedness
wild
young
fellows
bumptious
students
who
set
aside
all
considerations
are
really
philistines
since
with
them
as
with
the
latter
considerations
form
the
substance
of
their
conduct
only
that
as
swaggerers
they
are
mutinous
against
considerations
and
in
negative
relations
to
them
but
as
philistines
later
they
give
themselves
up
to
considerations
and
have
positive
relations
to
them
in
both
cases
all
their
doing
and
thinking
turns
upon
considerations
but
the
philistine
is
reactionary
in
relation
to
the
student
he
is
the
wild
fellow
come
to
discreet
reflection
as
the
latter
is
the
unreflecting
philistine
daily
experience
confirms
the
truth
of
this
transformation
and
shows
how
the
swaggerers
turn
to
philistines
in
turning
gray
so
too
the
so
called
reaction
in
germany
gives
proof
that
it
was
only
the
discreet
continuation
of
the
warlike
jubilation
of
liberty
the
revolution
was
not
directed
against
the
established
but
against
the
establishment
in
question
against
a
particular
establishment
it
did
away
with
this
ruler
not
with
the
ruler
q
on
the
contrary
the
french
were
ruled
most
inexorably
it
killed
the
old
vicious
rulers
but
wanted
to
confer
on
the
virtuous
ones
a
securely
established
position
that
is
it
simply
set
virtue
in
the
place
of
vice
vice
and
virtue
again
are
on
their
part
distinguished
from
each
other
only
as
a
wild
young
fellow
from
a
philistine
to
this
day
the
revolutionary
principle
has
gone
no
farther
than
to
assail
only
one
or
another
particular
establishment
to
be
reformatory
much
as
may
be
improved
strongly
as
discreet
progress
may
be
adhered
to
always
there
is
only
a
new
master
set
in
the
old
ones
place
and
the
overturning
is
a
q
building
up
we
are
still
at
the
distinction
of
the
young
philistine
from
the
old
one
the
revolution
began
in
bourgeois
fashion
with
the
uprising
of
the
third
estate
the
middle
class
in
bourgeois
fashion
it
dries
away
it
was
not
the
individual
man
q
and
he
alone
is
man
q
that
became
free
but
the
citizen
the
citoyen
the
political
man
who
for
that
very
reason
is
not
man
but
a
specimen
of
the
human
species
and
more
particularly
a
specimen
of
the
species
citizen
a
free
citizen
in
the
revolution
it
was
not
the
individual
who
acted
so
as
to
affect
the
worlds
history
but
a
people
the
nation
the
sovereign
nation
wanted
to
effect
everything
a
fancied
i
an
idea
such
as
the
nation
is
appears
acting
the
individuals
contribute
themselves
as
tools
of
this
idea
and
act
as
citizens
the
commonalty
has
its
power
and
at
the
same
time
its
limits
in
the
fundamental
law
of
the
state
in
a
charter
in
a
legitimate
or
just
prince
who
himself
is
guided
and
rules
according
to
rational
laws
in
short
in
legality
the
period
of
the
bourgeoisie
is
ruled
by
the
british
spirit
of
legality
an
assembly
of
provincial
estates
is
ever
recalling
that
its
authorization
goes
only
so
and
so
far
and
that
it
is
called
at
all
only
through
favour
and
can
be
thrown
out
again
through
disfavour
it
is
always
reminding
itself
of
its
q
vocation
it
is
certainly
not
to
be
denied
that
my
father
begot
me
but
now
that
i
am
once
begotten
surely
his
purposes
in
begetting
do
not
concern
me
a
bit
and
whatever
he
may
have
called
me
to
i
do
what
i
myself
will
therefore
even
a
called
assembly
of
estates
the
french
assembly
in
the
beginning
of
the
revolution
recognized
quite
rightly
that
it
was
independent
of
the
caller
it
existed
and
would
have
been
stupid
if
it
did
not
avail
itself
of
the
right
of
existence
but
fancied
itself
dependent
as
on
a
father
the
called
one
no
longer
has
to
ask
what
did
the
caller
want
when
he
created
me
but
what
do
i
want
after
i
have
once
followed
the
call
not
the
caller
not
the
constituents
not
the
charter
according
to
which
their
meeting
was
called
out
nothing
will
be
to
him
a
sacred
inviolable
power
he
is
authorized
for
everything
that
is
in
his
power
he
will
know
no
restrictive
authorization
will
not
want
to
be
loyal
this
if
any
such
thing
could
be
expected
from
chambers
at
all
would
give
a
completely
egoistic
chamber
severed
from
all
navel
string
and
without
consideration
but
chambers
are
always
devout
and
therefore
one
cannot
be
surprised
if
so
much
half
way
or
undecided
that
is
hypocritical
egoism
parades
in
them
the
members
of
the
estates
are
to
remain
within
the
limits
that
are
traced
for
them
by
the
charter
by
the
kings
will
and
the
like
if
they
will
not
or
can
not
do
that
then
they
are
to
step
out
what
dutiful
man
could
act
otherwise
could
put
himself
his
conviction
and
his
will
as
the
first
thing
who
could
be
so
immoral
as
to
want
to
assert
himself
even
if
the
body
corporate
and
everything
should
go
to
ruin
over
it
people
keep
carefully
within
the
limits
of
their
authorization
of
course
one
must
remain
within
the
limits
of
his
power
anyhow
because
no
one
can
do
more
than
he
can
my
power
or
if
it
be
so
powerlessness
be
my
sole
limit
but
authorizations
only
restraining
q
precepts
should
i
profess
this
all
subversive
view
no
i
am
a
q
law
abiding
citizen
the
commonalty
professes
a
morality
which
is
most
closely
connected
with
its
essence
the
first
demand
of
this
morality
is
to
the
effect
that
one
should
carry
on
a
solid
business
an
honourable
trade
lead
a
moral
life
immoral
to
it
is
the
sharper
the
demirep
the
thief
robber
and
murderer
the
gamester
the
penniless
man
without
a
situation
the
frivolous
man
the
doughty
commoner
designates
the
feeling
against
these
immoral
people
as
his
deepest
indignation
all
these
lack
settlement
the
solid
quality
of
business
a
solid
seemly
life
a
fixed
income
etc
in
short
they
belong
because
their
existence
does
not
rest
on
a
secure
basis
to
the
dangerous
individuals
or
isolated
persons
to
the
dangerous
proletariat
they
are
individual
bawlers
who
offer
no
guarantee
and
have
nothing
to
lose
and
so
nothing
to
risk
the
forming
of
family
ties
binds
a
man
he
who
is
bound
furnishes
security
can
be
taken
hold
of
not
so
the
street
walker
the
gamester
stakes
everything
on
the
game
ruins
himself
and
others
q
no
guarantee
all
who
appear
to
the
commoner
suspicious
hostile
and
dangerous
might
be
comprised
under
the
name
vagabonds
every
vagabondish
way
of
living
displeases
him
for
there
are
intellectual
vagabonds
too
to
whom
the
hereditary
dwelling
place
of
their
fathers
seems
too
cramped
and
oppressive
for
them
to
be
willing
to
satisfy
themselves
with
the
limited
space
any
more
instead
of
keeping
within
the
limits
of
a
temperate
style
of
thinking
and
taking
as
inviolable
truth
what
furnishes
comfort
and
tranquillity
to
thousands
they
overlap
all
bounds
of
the
traditional
and
run
wild
with
their
impudent
criticism
and
untamed
mania
for
doubt
these
extravagating
vagabonds
they
form
the
class
of
the
unstable
restless
changeable
of
the
proletariat
and
if
they
give
voice
to
their
unsettled
nature
are
called
unruly
fellows
such
a
broad
sense
has
the
so
called
proletariat
or
pauperism
how
much
one
would
err
if
one
believed
the
commonalty
to
be
desirous
of
doing
away
with
poverty
pauperism
to
the
best
of
its
ability
on
the
contrary
the
good
citizen
helps
himself
with
the
incomparably
comforting
conviction
that
the
fact
is
that
the
good
things
of
fortune
are
unequally
divided
and
will
always
remain
so
q
according
to
gods
wise
decree
the
poverty
which
surrounds
him
in
every
alley
does
not
disturb
the
true
commoner
further
than
that
at
most
he
clears
his
account
with
it
by
throwing
an
alms
or
finds
work
and
food
for
an
honest
and
serviceable
fellow
but
so
much
the
more
does
he
feel
his
quiet
enjoyment
clouded
by
innovating
and
discontented
poverty
by
those
poor
who
no
longer
behave
quietly
and
endure
but
begin
to
run
wild
and
become
restless
lock
up
the
vagabond
thrust
the
breeder
of
unrest
into
the
darkest
dungeon
he
wants
to
arouse
dissatisfaction
and
incite
people
against
existing
institutions
in
the
state
q
stone
him
stone
him
but
from
these
identical
discontented
ones
comes
a
reasoning
somewhat
as
follows
it
need
not
make
any
difference
to
the
good
citizens
who
protects
them
and
their
principles
whether
an
absolute
king
or
a
constitutional
one
a
republic
if
only
they
are
protected
and
what
is
their
principle
whose
protector
they
always
love
not
that
of
labour
not
that
of
birth
either
but
that
of
mediocrity
of
the
golden
mean
a
little
birth
and
a
little
labour
that
is
an
interest
bearing
possession
possession
is
here
the
fixed
the
given
inherited
birth
interest
drawing
is
the
exertion
about
it
labour
labouring
capital
therefore
only
no
immoderation
no
ultra
no
radicalism
right
of
birth
certainly
but
only
hereditary
possessions
labour
certainly
yet
little
or
none
at
all
of
ones
own
but
labour
of
capital
and
of
the
q
subject
labourers
if
an
age
is
imbued
with
an
error
some
always
derive
advantage
from
the
error
while
the
rest
have
to
suffer
from
it
in
the
middle
ages
the
error
was
general
among
christians
that
the
church
must
have
all
power
or
the
supreme
lordship
on
earth
the
hierarchs
believed
in
this
truth
not
less
than
the
laymen
and
both
were
spellbound
in
the
like
error
but
by
it
the
hierarchs
had
the
advantage
of
power
the
laymen
had
to
suffer
subjection
however
as
the
saying
goes
one
learns
wisdom
by
suffering
and
so
the
laymen
at
last
learned
wisdom
and
no
longer
believed
in
the
medieval
truth
q
a
like
relation
exists
between
the
commonalty
and
the
labouring
class
commoner
and
labourer
believe
in
the
truth
of
money
they
who
do
not
possess
it
believe
in
it
no
less
than
those
who
possess
it
the
laymen
therefore
as
well
as
the
priests
money
governs
the
world
is
the
keynote
of
the
civic
epoch
a
destitute
aristocrat
and
a
destitute
labourer
as
starvelings
amount
to
nothing
so
far
as
political
consideration
is
concerned
birth
and
labour
do
not
do
it
but
money
brings
consideration

the
possessors
rule
but
the
state
trains
up
from
the
destitute
its
servants
to
whom
in
proportion
as
they
are
to
rule
govern
in
its
name
it
gives
money
a
salary
i
receive
everything
from
the
state
have
i
anything
without
the
states
assent
what
i
have
without
this
it
takes
from
me
as
soon
as
it
discovers
the
lack
of
a
legal
title
do
i
not
therefore
have
everything
through
its
grace
its
assent
on
this
alone
on
the
legal
title
the
commonalty
rests
the
commoner
is
what
he
is
through
the
protection
of
the
state
through
the
states
grace
he
would
necessarily
be
afraid
of
losing
everything
if
the
states
power
wer
e
broken
but
how
is
it
with
him
who
has
nothing
to
lose
how
with
the
proletarian
as
he
has
nothing
to
lose
he
does
not
need
the
protection
of
the
state
for
his
nothing
he
may
gain
on
the
contrary
if
that
protection
of
the
state
is
withdrawn
from
the
protg
therefore
the
non
possessor
will
regard
the
state
as
a
power
protecting
the
possessor
which
privileges
the
latter
but
does
nothing
for
him
the
non
possessor
but
to
q
suck
his
blood
the
state
is
a
commoners
state
is
the
estate
of
the
commonalty
it
protects
man
not
according
to
his
labour
but
according
to
his
tractableness
loyalty
q
to
wit
according
to
whether
the
rights
entrusted
to
him
by
the
state
are
enjoyed
and
managed
in
accordance
with
the
will
that
is
laws
of
the
state
under
the
regime
of
the
commonalty
the
labourers
always
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
possessors
of
those
who
have
at
their
disposal
some
bit
of
the
state
domains
and
everything
possessible
in
state
domain
belongs
to
the
state
and
is
only
a
fief
of
the
individual
especially
money
and
land
of
the
capitalists
therefore
the
labourer
cannot
realize
on
his
labour
to
the
extent
of
the
value
that
it
has
for
the
consumer
labour
is
badly
paid
the
capitalist
has
the
greatest
profit
from
it
q
well
paid
and
more
than
well
paid
are
only
the
labours
of
those
who
heighten
the
splendour
and
dominion
of
the
state
the
labours
of
high
state
servants
the
state
pays
well
that
its
good
citizens
the
possessors
may
be
able
to
pay
badly
without
danger
it
secures
to
itself
by
good
payment
its
servants
out
of
whom
it
forms
a
protecting
power
a
police
to
the
police
belong
soldiers
officials
of
all
kinds
those
of
justice
education
etc
q
in
short
the
whole
machinery
of
the
state
for
the
good
citizens
and
the
good
citizens
gladly
pay
high
tax
rates
to
it
in
order
to
pay
so
much
lower
rates
to
their
labourers
but
the
class
of
labourers
because
unprotected
in
what
they
essentially
are
for
they
do
not
enjoy
the
protection
of
the
state
as
labourers
but
as
its
subjects
they
have
a
share
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
police
a
so
called
protection
of
the
law
remains
a
power
hostile
to
this
state
this
state
of
possessors
this
citizen
kingship
its
principle
labour
is
not
recognized
as
to
its
value
it
is
exploited

a
spoil
of
the
possessors
the
enemy
the
labourers
have
the
most
enormous
power
in
their
hands
and
if
they
once
became
thoroughly
conscious
of
it
and
used
it
nothing
would
withstand
them
they
would
only
have
to
stop
labour
regard
the
product
of
labour
as
theirs
and
enjoy
it
this
is
the
sense
of
the
labour
disturbances
which
show
themselves
here
and
there
the
state
rests
on
the
q
slavery
of
labour
if
labour
becomes
free
the
state
is
lost

social
liberalism
we
are
freeborn
men
and
wherever
we
look
we
see
ourselves
made
servants
of
egoists
are
we
therefore
to
become
egoists
too
heaven
forbid
we
want
rather
to
make
egoists
impossible
we
want
to
make
them
all
ragamuffins
all
of
us
must
have
nothing
that
all
may
have
so
say
the
socialists
who
is
this
person
that
you
call
all
q
it
is
society
but
is
it
corporeal
then
q
we
are
its
body
q
you
why
you
are
not
a
body
yourselves
q
you
sir
are
corporeal
to
be
sure
you
too
and
you
but
you
all
together
are
only
bodies
not
a
body
accordingly
the
united
society
may
indeed
have
bodies
at
its
service
but
no
one
body
of
its
own
like
the
nation
of
the
politicians
it
will
turn
out
to
be
nothing
but
a
spirit
its
body
only
semblance
the
freedom
of
man
is
in
political
liberalism
freedom
from
persons
from
personal
dominion
from
the
master
the
securing
of
each
individual
person
against
other
persons
personal
freedom
no
one
has
any
orders
to
give
the
law
alone
gives
orders
but
even
if
the
persons
have
become
equal
yet
their
possessions
have
not
and
yet
the
poor
man
needs
the
rich
the
rich
the
poor
the
former
the
rich
mans
money
the
latter
the
poor
mans
labour
so
no
one
needs
another
as
a
person
but
needs
him
as
a
giver
and
thus
as
one
who
has
something
to
give
as
holder
or
possessor
so
what
he
has
makes
the
man
and
in
having
or
in
possessions
people
are
unequal
consequently
social
liberalism
concludes
no
one
must
have
as
according
to
political
liberalism
no
one
was
to
give
orders
as
in
that
case
the
state
alone
obtained
the
command
so
now
society
alone
obtains
the
possessions
for
the
state
protecting
each
ones
person
and
property
against
the
other
separates
them
from
one
another
each
one
is
his
special
part
and
has
his
special
part
he
who
is
satisfied
with
what
he
is
and
has
finds
this
state
of
things
profitable
but
he
who
would
like
to
be
and
have
more
looks
around
for
this
more
and
finds
it
in
the
power
of
other
persons
here
he
comes
upon
a
contradiction
as
a
person
no
one
is
inferior
to
another
and
yet
one
person
has
what
another
has
not
but
would
like
to
have
so
he
concludes
the
one
person
is
more
than
the
other
after
all
for
the
former
has
what
he
needs
the
latter
has
not
the
former
is
a
rich
man
the
latter
a
poor
man
he
now
asks
himself
further
are
we
to
let
what
we
rightly
buried
come
to
life
again
are
we
to
let
this
circuitously
restored
inequality
of
persons
pass
no
on
the
contrary
we
must
bring
quite
to
an
end
what
was
only
half
accomplished
our
freedom
from
anothers
person
still
lacks
the
freedom
from
what
the
others
person
can
command
from
what
he
has
in
his
personal
power
q
in
short
from
personal
property
let
us
then
do
away
with
personal
property
let
no
one
have
anything
any
longer
let
every
one
be
a
q
ragamuffin
let
property
be
impersonal
let
it
belong
to
society
before
the
supreme
ruler
the
sole
commander
we
had
all
become
equal
equal
persons
that
is
nullities
before
the
supreme
proprietor
we
all
become
equal
q
ragamuffins
for
the
present
one
is
still
in
anothers
estimation
a
ragamuffin
a
have
nothing
but
then
this
estimation
ceases
we
are
all
ragamuffins
together
and
as
the
aggregate
of
communistic
society
we
might
call
ourselves
a
ragamuffin
crew
when
the
proletarian
shall
really
have
founded
his
purposed
society
in
which
the
interval
between
rich
and
poor
is
to
be
removed
then
he
will
be
a
ragamuffin
for
then
he
will
feel
that
it
amounts
to
something
to
be
a
ragamuffin
and
might
lift
ragamuffin
to
be
an
honourable
form
of
address
just
as
the
revolution
did
with
the
word
citizen
ragamuffin
is
his
ideal
we
are
all
to
become
ragamuffins
this
is
the
second
robbery
of
the
personal
in
the
interest
of
humanity
neither
command
nor
property
is
left
to
the
individual
the
state
took
the
former
society
the
latter
because
in
society
the
most
oppressive
evils
make
themselves
felt
therefore
the
oppressed
especially
and
consequently
the
members
of
the
lower
regions
of
society
think
they
found
the
fault
in
society
and
make
it
their
task
to
discover
the
right
society
this
is
only
the
old
phenomenon
q
that
one
looks
for
the
fault
first
in
everything
but
himself
and
consequently
in
the
state
in
the
self
seeking
of
the
rich
and
so
on
which
yet
have
precisely
our
fault
to
thank
for
their
existence
the
reflections
and
conclusions
of
communism
look
very
simple
as
matters
lie
at
this
time
in
the
present
situation
with
regard
to
the
state
therefore
q
some
and
they
the
majority
are
at
a
disadvantage
compared
to
others
the
minority
in
this
state
of
things
the
former
are
in
a
state
of
prosperity
the
latter
in
state
of
need
hence
the
present
state
of
things
the
state
itself
must
be
done
away
with
and
what
in
its
place
instead
of
the
isolated
state
of
prosperity
q
a
general
state
of
prosperity
a
prosperity
of
all
through
the
revolution
the
bourgeoisie
became
omnipotent
and
all
inequality
was
abolished
by
every
ones
being
raised
or
degraded
to
the
dignity
of
a
citizen
the
common
man
q
raised
the
aristocrat
q
degraded
the
third
estate
became
sole
estate
namely
the
estate
of
q
citizens
of
the
state
now
communism
responds
our
dignity
and
our
essence
consist
not
in
our
being
all
q
the
equal
children
of
our
mother
the
state
all
born
with
equal
claim
to
her
love
and
her
protection
but
in
our
all
existing
for
each
other
this
is
our
equality
or
herein
we
are
equal
in
that
we
i
as
well
as
you
and
you
and
all
of
you
are
active
or
labour
each
one
for
the
rest
in
that
each
of
us
is
a
labourer
then
the
point
for
us
is
not
what
we
are
for
the
state
citizens
not
our
citizenship
therefore
but
what
we
are
for
each
other
that
each
of
us
exists
only
through
the
other
who
caring
for
my
wants
at
the
same
time
sees
his
own
satisfied
by
me
he
labours
for
my
clothing
tailor
i
for
his
need
of
amusement
comedy
writer
rope
dancer
he
for
my
food
farmer
i
for
his
instruction
scientist
it
is
labour
that
constitutes
our
dignity
and
our
q
equality
what
advantage
does
citizenship
bring
us
burdens
and
how
high
is
our
labour
appraised
as
low
as
possible
but
labour
is
our
sole
value
all
the
same
that
we
are
labourers
is
the
best
thing
about
us
this
is
our
significance
in
the
world
and
therefore
it
must
be
our
consideration
too
and
must
come
to
receive
consideration
what
can
you
meet
us
with
surely
nothing
but
q
labour
too
only
for
labour
or
services
do
we
owe
you
a
recompense
not
for
your
bare
existence
not
for
what
you
are
for
yourselves
either
but
only
for
what
you
are
for
us
by
what
have
you
claims
on
us
perhaps
by
your
high
birth
no
only
by
what
you
do
for
us
that
is
desirable
or
useful
be
it
thus
then
we
are
willing
to
be
worth
to
you
only
so
much
as
we
do
for
you
but
you
are
to
be
held
likewise
by
us
services
determine
value
those
services
that
are
worth
something
to
us
and
consequently
labours
for
each
other
labours
for
the
common
good
let
each
one
be
in
the
others
eyes
a
labourer
he
who
accomplishes
something
useful
is
inferior
to
none
or
q
all
labourers
labourers
of
course
in
the
sense
of
labourers
for
the
common
good
that
is
communistic
labourers
are
equal
but
as
the
labourer
is
worth
his
wages

let
the
wages
too
be
equal
as
long
as
faith
sufficed
for
mans
honour
and
dignity
no
labour
however
harassing
could
be
objected
to
if
it
only
did
not
hinder
a
man
in
his
faith
now
on
the
contrary
when
every
one
is
to
cultivate
himself
into
man
condemning
a
man
to
machine
like
labour
amounts
to
the
same
thing
as
slavery
if
a
factory
worker
must
tire
himself
to
death
twelve
hours
and
more
he
is
cut
off
from
becoming
man
every
labour
is
to
have
the
intent
that
the
man
be
satisfied
therefore
he
must
become
a
master
in
it
too
be
able
to
perform
it
as
a
totality
he
who
in
a
pinfactory
only
puts
on
the
heads
only
draws
the
wire
works
as
it
were
mechanically
like
a
machine
he
remains
half
trained
does
not
become
a
master
his
labour
cannot
satisfy
him
it
can
only
fatigue
him
his
labour
is
nothing
by
itself
has
no
object
in
itself
is
nothing
complete
in
itself
he
labours
only
into
anothers
hands
and
is
used
exploited
by
this
other
for
this
labourer
in
anothers
service
there
is
no
enjoyment
of
a
cultivated
mind
at
most
crude
amusements
culture
you
see
is
barred
against
him
to
be
a
good
christian
one
needs
only
to
believe
and
that
can
be
done
under
the
most
oppressive
circumstances
hence
the
christian
minded
take
care
only
of
the
oppressed
labourers
piety
their
patience
submission
etc
only
so
long
as
the
downtrodden
classes
were
christians
could
they
bear
all
their
misery
for
christianity
does
not
let
their
murmurings
and
exasperation
rise
now
the
hushing
of
desires
is
no
longer
enough
but
their
sating
is
demanded
the
bourgeoisie
has
proclaimed
the
gospel
of
the
enjoyment
of
the
world
of
material
enjoyment
and
now
wonders
that
this
doctrine
finds
adherents
among
us
poor
it
has
shown
that
not
faith
and
poverty
but
culture
and
possessions
make
a
man
blessed
we
proletarians
understand
that
too
the
commonalty
freed
us
from
the
orders
and
arbitrariness
of
individuals
but
that
arbitrariness
was
left
which
springs
from
the
conjuncture
of
situations
and
may
be
called
the
fortuity
of
circumstances
favouring
fortune
and
those
favoured
by
fortune
still
remain
when
for
example
a
branch
of
industry
is
ruined
and
thousands
of
labourers
become
breadless
people
think
reasonably
enough
to
acknowledge
that
it
is
not
the
individual
who
must
bear
the
blame
but
that
the
evil
lies
in
the
situation
let
us
change
the
situation
then
but
let
us
change
it
thoroughly
and
so
that
its
fortuity
becomes
powerless
and
a
law
let
us
no
longer
be
slaves
of
chance
let
us
create
a
new
order
that
makes
an
end
of
fluctuations
let
this
order
then
be
sacred
formerly
one
had
to
suit
the
lords
to
come
to
anything
after
the
revolution
the
word
was
grasp
fortune
luck
hunting
or
hazard
playing
civil
life
was
absorbed
in
this
then
alongside
this
the
demand
that
he
who
has
obtained
something
shall
not
frivolously
stake
it
again
strange
and
yet
supremely
natural
contradiction
competition
in
which
alone
civil
or
political
life
unrolls
itself
is
a
game
of
luck
through
and
through
from
the
speculations
of
the
exchange
down
to
the
solicitation
of
offices
the
hunt
for
customers
looking
for
work
aspiring
to
promotion
and
decorations
the
second
hand
dealers
petty
haggling
etc
if
one
succeeds
in
supplanting
and
outbidding
his
rivals
then
the
lucky
throw
is
made
for
it
must
be
taken
as
a
piece
of
luck
to
begin
with
that
the
victor
sees
himself
equipped
with
an
ability
even
though
it
has
been
developed
by
the
most
careful
industry
against
which
the
others
do
not
know
how
to
rise
consequently
that
q
no
abler
ones
are
found
and
now
those
who
ply
their
daily
lives
in
the
midst
of
these
changes
of
fortune
without
seeing
any
harm
in
it
are
seized
with
the
most
virtuous
indignation
when
their
own
principle
appears
in
naked
form
and
breeds
misfortune
as
q
hazard
playing
hazard
playing
you
see
is
too
clear
too
barefaced
a
competition
and
like
every
decided
nakedness
offends
honourable
modesty
the
socialists
want
to
put
a
stop
to
this
activity
of
chance
and
to
form
a
society
in
which
men
are
no
longer
dependent
on
fortune
but
free
in
the
most
natural
way
in
the
world
this
endeavour
first
utters
itself
as
hatred
of
the
unfortunate
against
the
fortunate
of
those
for
whom
fortune
has
done
little
or
nothing
against
those
for
whom
it
has
done
everything
but
properly
the
ill
feeling
is
not
directed
against
the
fortunate
but
against
fortune
this
rotten
spot
of
the
commonalty
as
the
communists
first
declare
free
activity
to
be
mans
essence
they
like
all
work
day
dispositions
need
a
sunday
like
all
material
endeavours
they
need
a
god
an
uplifting
and
edification
alongside
their
witless
labour
that
the
communist
sees
in
you
the
man
the
brother
is
only
the
sunday
side
of
communism
according
to
the
work
day
side
he
does
not
by
any
means
take
you
as
man
simply
but
as
human
labourer
or
labouring
man
the
first
view
has
in
it
the
liberal
principle
in
the
second
illiberality
is
concealed
if
you
were
a
lazy
bones
he
would
not
indeed
fail
to
recognize
the
man
in
you
but
would
endeavour
to
cleanse
him
as
a
lazy
man
from
laziness
and
to
convert
you
to
the
faith
that
labour
is
mans
destiny
and
calling
therefore
he
shows
a
double
face
with
the
one
he
takes
heed
that
the
spiritual
man
be
satisfied
with
the
other
he
looks
about
him
lor
means
for
the
material
or
corporeal
man
he
gives
man
a
twofold
post
an
office
of
material
acquisition
and
one
of
spiritual
the
commonalty
had
thrown
open
spiritual
and
material
goods
and
left
it
with
each
one
to
reach
out
for
them
if
he
liked
communism
really
procures
them
for
each
one
presses
them
upon
him
and
compels
him
to
acquire
them
it
takes
seriously
the
idea
that
because
only
spiritual
and
material
goods
make
us
men
we
must
unquestionably
acquire
these
goods
in
order
to
be
man
the
commonalty
made
acquisition
free
communism
compels
to
acquisition
and
recognizes
only
the
acquirer
him
who
practices
a
trade
it
is
not
enough
that
the
trade
is
free
but
you
must
take
it
up
so
all
that
is
left
for
criticism
to
do
is
to
prove
that
the
acquisition
of
these
goods
does
not
yet
by
any
means
make
us
men
with
the
liberal
commandment
that
every
one
is
to
make
a
man
of
himself
or
every
one
to
make
himself
man
there
was
posited
the
necessity
that
every
one
must
gain
time
for
this
labour
of
humanization
that
is
that
it
should
become
possible
for
every
one
to
labour
on
himself
the
commonalty
thought
it
had
brought
this
about
if
it
handed
over
everything
human
to
competition
but
gave
the
individual
a
right
to
every
human
thing
each
may
strive
after
everything
social
liberalism
finds
that
the
matter
is
not
settled
with
the
may
because
may
means
only
it
is
forbidden
to
none
but
not
it
is
made
possible
to
every
one
hence
it
affirms
that
the
commonalty
is
liberal
only
with
the
mouth
and
in
words
supremely
illiberal
in
act
it
on
its
part
wants
to
give
all
of
us
the
means
to
be
able
to
labour
on
ourselves
by
the
principle
of
labour
that
of
fortune
or
competition
is
certainly
outdone
but
at
the
same
time
the
labourer
in
his
consciousness
that
the
essential
thing
in
him
is
the
labourer
holds
himself
aloof
from
egoism
and
subjects
himself
to
the
supremacy
of
a
society
of
labourers
as
the
commoner
clung
with
self
abandonment
to
the
competition
state
the
beautiful
dream
of
a
social
duty
still
continues
to
be
dreamed
people
think
again
that
society
gives
what
we
need
and
we
are
under
obligations
to
it
on
that
account
owe
it
everything

they
are
still
at
the
point
of
wanting
to
serve
a
supreme
giver
of
all
good
that
society
is
no
ego
at
all
which
could
give
bestow
or
grant
but
an
instrument
or
means
from
which
we
may
derive
benefit
that
we
have
no
social
duties
but
solely
interests
for
the
pursuance
of
which
society
must
serve
us
that
we
owe
society
no
sacrifice
but
if
we
sacrifice
anything
sacrifice
it
to
ourselves
q
of
this
the
socialists
do
not
think
because
they
q
as
liberals
q
are
imprisoned
in
the
religious
principle
and
zealously
aspire
after
q
a
sacred
society
such
as
the
state
was
hitherto
society
from
which
we
have
everything
is
a
new
master
a
new
spook
a
new
supreme
being
which
takes
us
into
its
service
and
allegiance
the
more
precise
appreciation
of
political
as
well
as
social
liberalism
must
wait
to
find
its
place
further
on
for
the
present
we
pass
this
over
in
order
first
to
summon
them
before
the
tribunal
of
humane
or
critical
liberalism

humane
liberalism
as
liberalism
is
completed
in
self
criticizing
critical
liberalism
q
in
which
the
critic
remains
a
liberal
and
does
not
go
beyond
the
principle
of
liberalism
man
q
this
may
distinctively
be
named
after
man
and
called
the
humane
the
labourer
is
counted
as
the
most
material
and
egoistical
man
he
does
nothing
at
all
for
humanity
does
everything
for
himself
for
his
welfare
the
commonalty
because
it
proclaimed
the
freedom
of
man
only
as
to
his
birth
had
to
leave
him
in
the
claws
of
the
un
human
man
the
egoist
for
the
rest
of
life
hence
under
the
regime
of
political
liberalism
egoism
has
an
immense
field
for
free
utilization
the
labourer
will
utilize
society
for
his
egoistic
ends
as
the
commoner
does
the
state
you
have
only
an
egoistic
end
after
all
your
welfare
is
the
humane
liberals
reproach
to
the
socialist
take
up
a
purely
human
interest
then
i
will
be
your
companion
but
to
this
there
belongs
a
consciousness
stronger
more
comprehensive
than
a
labourer
consciousness
the
labourer
makes
nothing
therefore
he
has
nothing
but
he
makes
nothing
because
his
labour
is
always
a
labour
that
remains
individual
calculated
strictly
for
his
own
want
a
labour
day
by
day

in
opposition
to
this
one
might
for
instance
consider
the
fact
that
gutenbergs
labour
did
not
remain
individual
but
begot
innumerable
children
and
still
lives
today
it
was
calculated
for
the
want
of
humanity
and
was
an
eternal
imperishable
labour
the
humane
consciousness
despises
the
commoner
consciousness
as
well
as
the
labourer
consciousness
for
the
commoner
is
indignant
only
at
vagabonds
at
all
who
have
no
definite
occupation
and
their
immorality
the
labourer
is
disgusted
by
the
idler
lazy
bones
and
his
immoral
because
parasitic
and
unsocial
principles
to
this
the
humane
liberal
retorts
the
unsettledness
of
many
is
only
your
product
philistine
but
that
you
proletarian
demand
the
grind
of
all
and
want
to
make
drudgery
general
is
a
part
still
clinging
to
you
of
your
pack
mule
life
up
to
this
time
certainly
you
want
to
lighten
drudgery
itself
by
all
having
to
drudge
equally
hard
yet
only
for
this
reason
that
all
may
gain
leisure
to
an
equal
extent
but
what
are
they
to
do
with
their
leisure
what
does
your
society
do
that
this
leisure
may
be
passed
humanly
it
must
leave
the
gained
leisure
to
egoistic
preference
again
and
the
very
gain
that
your
society
furthers
falls
to
the
egoist
as
the
gain
of
the
commonalty
the
masterlessness
of
man
could
not
be
filled
with
a
human
element
by
the
state
and
therefore
was
left
to
arbitrary
choice
it
is
assuredly
necessary
that
man
be
masterless
but
therefore
the
egoist
is
not
to
become
master
over
man
again
either
but
man
over
the
egoist
man
must
assuredly
find
leisure
but
if
the
egoist
makes
use
of
it
it
will
be
lost
for
man
therefore
you
ought
to
have
given
leisure
a
human
significance
but
you
labourers
undertake
even
your
labour
from
an
egoistic
impulse
because
you
want
to
eat
drink
live
how
should
you
be
less
egoists
in
leisure
you
labour
only
because
having
your
time
to
yourselves
idling
goes
well
after
work
done
and
what
you
are
to
while
away
your
leisure
time
with
is
left
to
chance
but
if
every
door
is
to
be
bolted
against
egoism
it
would
be
necessary
to
strive
after
completely
disinterested
action
total
disinterestedness
this
alone
is
human
because
only
man
is
disinterested
the
egoist
always
interested

if
we
let
disinterestedness
pass
unchallenged
for
a
while
then
we
ask
do
you
mean
not
to
take
an
interest
in
anything
not
to
be
enthusiastic
for
anything
not
for
liberty
humanity
etc
oh
yes
but
that
is
not
an
egoistic
interest
not
interestedness
but
a
human
a
q
theoretical
interest
to
wit
an
interest
not
for
an
individual
or
individuals
all
but
for
the
idea
for
man
and
you
do
not
notice
that
you
too
are
enthusiastic
only
for
your
idea
your
idea
of
liberty
and
further
do
you
not
notice
that
your
disinterestedness
is
again
like
religious
disinterestedness
a
heavenly
interestedness
certainly
benefit
to
the
individual
leaves
you
cold
and
abstractly
you
could
cry
fiat
libertas
pereat
mundus
you
do
not
take
thought
for
the
coming
day
either
and
take
no
serious
care
for
the
individuals
wants
anyhow
not
for
your
own
comfort
nor
for
that
of
the
rest
but
you
make
nothing
of
all
this
because
you
are
a
q
dreamer
do
you
suppose
the
humane
liberal
will
be
so
liberal
as
to
aver
that
everything
possible
to
man
is
human
on
the
contrary
he
does
not
indeed
share
the
philistines
moral
prejudice
about
the
strumpet
but
that
this
woman
turns
her
body
into
a
money
getting
machine
makes
her
despicable
to
him
as
human
being
his
judgment
is
the
strumpet
is
not
a
human
being
or
so
far
as
a
woman
is
a
strumpet
so
far
is
she
unhuman
dehumanized
further
the
jew
the
christian
the
privileged
person
the
theologian
etc
is
not
a
human
being
so
far
as
you
are
a
jew
etc
you
are
not
a
human
being
again
the
imperious
postulate
cast
from
you
everything
peculiar
criticize
it
away
be
not
a
jew
not
a
christian
but
be
a
human
being
nothing
but
a
human
being
assert
your
humanity
against
every
restrictive
specification
make
yourself
by
means
of
it
a
human
being
and
free
from
those
limits
make
yourself
a
free
man
q
recognize
humanity
as
your
all
determining
essence
i
say
you
are
indeed
more
than
a
jew
more
than
a
christian
etc
but
you
are
also
more
than
a
human
being
those
are
all
ideas
but
you
are
corporeal
do
you
suppose
then
that
you
can
ever
become
a
human
being
as
such
do
you
suppose
our
posterity
will
find
no
prejudices
and
limits
to
clear
away
for
which
our
powers
were
not
sufficient
or
do
you
perhaps
think
that
in
your
fortieth
or
fiftieth
year
you
have
come
so
far
that
the
following
days
have
nothing
more
to
dissipate
in
you
and
that
you
are
a
human
being
the
men
of
the
future
will
yet
fight
their
way
to
many
a
liberty
that
we
do
not
even
miss
what
do
you
need
that
later
liberty
for
if
you
meant
to
esteem
yourself
as
nothing
before
you
had
become
a
human
being
you
would
have
to
wait
till
the
last
judgment
till
the
day
when
man
or
humanity
shall
have
attained
perfection
but
as
you
will
surely
die
before
that
what
becomes
of
your
prize
of
victory
rather
therefore
invert
the
case
and
say
to
yourself
i
am
a
human
being
i
do
not
need
to
begin
by
producing
the
human
being
in
myself
for
he
belongs
to
me
already
like
all
my
qualities
but
asks
the
critic
how
can
one
be
a
jew
and
a
man
at
once
in
the
first
place
i
answer
one
cannot
be
either
a
jew
or
a
man
at
all
if
one
and
jew
or
man
are
to
mean
the
same
one
always
reaches
beyond
those
specifications
and
q
let
isaacs
be
ever
so
jewish
q
a
jew
nothing
but
a
jew
he
cannot
be
just
because
he
is
this
jew
in
the
second
place
as
a
jew
one
assuredly
cannot
be
a
man
if
being
a
man
means
being
nothing
special
but
in
the
third
place
q
and
this
is
the
point
q
i
can
as
a
jew
be
entirely
what
i
can
be
from
samuel
or
moses
and
others
you
hardly
expect
that
they
should
have
raised
themselves
above
judaism
although
you
must
say
that
they
were
not
yet
men
they
simply
were
what
they
could
be
is
it
otherwise
with
the
jews
of
today
because
you
have
discovered
the
idea
of
humanity
does
it
follow
from
this
that
every
jew
can
become
a
convert
to
it
if
he
can
he
does
not
fail
to
and
if
he
fails
to
he
q
cannot
what
does
your
demand
concern
him
what
the
call
to
be
a
man
which
you
address
to
him

as
a
universal
principle
in
the
human
society
which
the
humane
liberal
promises
nothing
special
which
one
or
another
has
is
to
find
recognition
nothing
which
bears
the
character
of
private
is
to
have
value
in
this
way
the
circle
of
liberalism
which
has
its
good
principle
in
man
and
human
liberty
its
bad
in
the
egoist
and
everything
private
its
god
in
the
former
its
devil
in
the
latter
rounds
itself
off
completely
and
if
the
special
or
private
person
lost
his
value
in
the
state
no
personal
prerogative
if
in
the
labourers
or
ragamuffins
society
special
private
property
is
no
longer
recognized
so
in
human
society
everything
special
or
private
will
be
left
out
of
account
and
when
pure
criticism
shall
have
accomplished
its
arduous
task
then
it
will
be
known
just
what
we
must
look
upon
as
private
and
what
penetrated
with
a
sense
of
our
nothingness
we
must
q
let
stand
because
state
and
society
do
not
suffice
for
humane
liberalism
it
negates
both
and
at
the
same
time
retains
them
so
at
one
time
the
cry
is
that
the
task
of
the
day
is
not
a
political
but
a
social
one
and
then
again
the
free
state
is
promised
for
the
future
in
truth
human
society
is
both
q
the
most
general
state
and
the
most
general
society
only
against
the
limited
state
is
it
asserted
that
it
makes
too
much
stir
about
spiritual
private
interests
peoples
religious
belief
and
against
limited
society
that
it
makes
too
much
of
material
private
interests
both
are
to
leave
private
interests
to
private
people
and
as
human
society
concern
themselves
solely
about
general
human
interests
the
politicians
thinking
to
abolish
personal
will
self
will
or
arbitrariness
did
not
observe
that
through
property
our
self
will
gained
a
secure
place
of
refuge
the
socialists
taking
away
property
too
do
not
notice
that
this
secures
itself
a
continued
existence
in
self
ownership
is
it
only
money
and
goods
then
that
are
a
property
or
is
every
opinion
something
of
mine
something
of
my
own
so
every
opinion
must
be
abolished
or
made
impersonal
the
person
is
entitled
to
no
opinion
but
as
self
will
was
transferred
to
the
state
property
to
society
so
opinion
too
must
be
transferred
to
something
general
man
and
thereby
become
a
general
human
opinion
if
opinion
persists
then
i
have
my
god
why
god
exists
only
as
my
god
he
is
an
opinion
or
my
faith
and
consequently
my
faith
my
religion
my
thoughts
my
ideals
therefore
a
general
human
faith
must
come
into
existence
the
fanaticism
of
liberty
for
this
would
be
a
faith
that
agreed
with
the
essence
of
man
and
because
only
man
is
reasonable
you
and
i
might
be
very
unreasonable
a
reasonable
faith
as
self
will
and
property
become
powerless
so
must
self
ownership
or
egoism
in
general
in
this
supreme
development
of
free
man
egoism
selfownership
is
combated
on
principle
and
such
subordinate
ends
as
the
social
welfare
of
the
socialists
etc
vanish
before
the
lofty
idea
of
humanity
everything
that
is
not
a
general
human
entity
is
something
separate
satisfies
only
some
or
one
or
if
it
satisfies
all
it
does
this
to
them
only
as
individuals
not
as
men
and
is
therefore
called
egoistic
to
the
socialists
welfare
is
still
the
supreme
aim
as
free
rivalry
was
the
approved
thing
to
the
political
liberals
now
welfare
is
free
too
and
we
are
free
to
achieve
welfare
just
as
he
who
wanted
to
enter
into
rivalry
competition
was
free
to
do
so
but
to
take
part
in
the
rivalry
you
need
only
to
be
commoners
to
take
part
in
the
welfare
only
to
be
labourers
neither
reaches
the
point
of
being
synonymous
with
man
it
is
truly
well
with
man
only
when
he
is
also
intellectually
free
for
man
is
mind
therefore
all
powers
that
are
alien
to
him
the
mind
q
all
superhuman
heavenly
unhuman
powers
q
must
be
overthrown
and
the
name
man
must
be
above
every
name
so
in
this
end
of
the
modern
age
age
of
the
moderns
there
returns
again
as
the
main
point
what
had
been
the
main
point
at
its
beginning
intellectual
liberty
to
the
communist
in
particular
the
humane
liberal
says
if
society
prescribes
to
you
your
activity
then
this
is
indeed
free
from
the
influence
of
the
individual
the
egoist
but
it
still
does
not
on
that
account
need
to
be
a
purely
human
activity
nor
you
to
be
a
complete
organ
of
humanity
what
kind
of
activity
society
demands
of
you
remains
accidental
you
know
it
might
give
you
a
place
in
building
a
temple
or
something
of
that
sort
or
even
if
not
that
you
might
yet
on
your
own
impulse
be
active
for
something
foolish
therefore
unhuman
yes
more
yet
you
really
labour
only
to
nourish
yourself
in
general
to
live
for
dear
lifes
sake
not
for
the
glorification
of
humanity
consequently
free
activity
is
not
attained
till
you
make
yourself
free
from
all
stupidities
from
everything
non
human
namely
egoistic
pertaining
only
to
the
individual
not
to
the
man
in
the
individual
dissipate
all
untrue
thoughts
that
obscure
man
or
the
idea
of
humanity
in
short
when
you
are
not
merely
unhampered
in
your
activity
but
the
substance
too
of
your
activity
is
only
what
is
human
and
you
live
and
work
only
for
humanity
but
this
is
not
the
case
so
long
as
the
aim
of
your
effort
is
only
your
welfare
and
that
of
all
what
you
do
for
the
society
of
ragamuffins
is
not
yet
anything
done
for
human
society
labouring
does
not
alone
make
you
a
man
because
it
is
something
formal
and
its
object
accidental
the
question
is
who
you
that
labour
are
as
far
as
labouring
goes
you
might
do
it
from
an
egoistic
material
impulse
merely
to
procure
nourishment
and
the
like
it
must
be
a
labour
furthering
humanity
calculated
for
the
good
of
humanity
serving
historical
human
evolution
q
in
short
a
human
labour
this
implies
two
things
one
that
it
be
useful
to
humanity
next
that
it
be
the
work
of
a
man
the
first
alone
may
be
the
case
with
every
labour
as
even
the
labours
of
nature
as
of
animals
are
utilized
by
humanity
for
the
furthering
of
science
etc
the
second
requires
that
he
who
labours
should
know
the
human
object
of
his
labour
and
as
he
can
have
this
consciousness
only
when
he
knows
himself
as
man
the
crucial
condition
is
q
self
consciousness
unquestionably
much
is
already
attained
when
you
cease
to
be
a
fragment
labourer

yet
therewith
you
only
get
a
view
of
the
whole
of
your
labour
and
acquire
a
consciousness
about
it
which
is
still
far
removed
from
a
self
consciousness
a
consciousness
about
your
true
self
or
essence
man
the
labourer
has
still
remaining
the
desire
for
a
higher
consciousness
which
because
the
activity
of
labour
is
unable
to
quiet
it
he
satisfies
in
a
leisure
hour
hence
leisure
stands
by
the
side
of
his
labour
and
he
sees
himself
compelled
to
proclaim
labour
and
idling
human
in
one
breath
yes
to
attribute
the
true
elevation
to
the
idler
the
leisure
enjoyer
he
labours
only
to
get
rid
of
labour
he
wants
to
make
labour
free
only
that
he
may
be
free
from
labour
in
fine
his
work
has
no
satisfying
substance
because
it
is
only
imposed
by
society
only
a
stint
a
task
a
calling
and
conversely
his
society
does
not
satisfy
because
it
gives
only
work
his
labour
ought
to
satisfy
him
as
a
man
instead
of
that
it
satisfies
society
society
ought
to
treat
him
as
a
man
and
it
treats
him
as
q
a
rag
tag
labourer
or
a
labouring
ragamuffin
labour
and
society
are
of
use
to
him
not
as
he
needs
them
as
a
man
but
only
as
he
needs
them
as
an
egoist
such
is
the
attitude
of
criticism
toward
labour
it
points
to
mind
wages
the
war
of
mind
with
the
masses

and
pronounces
communistic
labour
unintellectual
mass
labour
averse
to
labour
as
they
are
the
masses
love
to
make
labour
easy
for
themselves
in
literature
which
is
today
furnished
in
mass
this
aversion
to
labour
begets
the
universally
known
superficiality
which
puts
from
it
the
toil
of
research

therefore
humane
liberalism
says
you
want
labour
all
right
we
want
it
likewise
but
we
want
it
in
the
fullest
measure
we
want
it
not
that
we
may
gain
spare
time
but
that
we
may
find
all
satisfaction
in
it
itself
we
want
labour
because
it
is
our
self
development
but
then
the
labour
too
must
be
adapted
to
that
end
man
is
honoured
only
by
human
self
conscious
labour
only
by
the
labour
that
has
for
its
end
no
egoistic
purpose
but
man
and
is
mans
self
revelation
so
that
the
saying
should
be
laboro
ergo
sum
i
labour
therefore
i
am
a
man
the
humane
liberal
wants
that
labour
of
the
mind
which
works
up
all
material
he
wants
the
mind
that
leaves
no
thing
quiet
or
in
its
existing
condition
that
acquiesces
in
nothing
analyzes
everything
criticizes
anew
every
result
that
has
been
gained
this
restless
mind
is
the
true
labourer
it
obliterates
prejudices
shatters
limits
and
narrownesses
and
raises
man
above
everything
that
would
like
to
dominate
over
him
while
the
communist
labours
only
for
himself
and
not
even
freely
but
from
necessity
q
in
short
represents
a
man
condemned
to
hard
labour
the
labourer
of
such
a
type
is
not
egoistic
because
he
does
not
labour
for
individuals
neither
for
himself
nor
for
other
individuals
not
for
private
men
therefore
but
for
humanity
and
its
progress
he
does
not
ease
individual
pains
does
not
care
for
individual
wants
but
removes
limits
within
which
humanity
is
pressed
dispels
prejudices
which
dominate
an
entire
time
vanquishes
hindrances
that
obstruct
the
path
of
all
clears
away
errors
in
which
men
entangle
themselves
discovers
truths
which
are
found
through
him
for
all
and
for
all
time
in
short
q
he
lives
and
labours
for
humanity
now
in
the
first
place
the
discoverer
of
a
great
truth
doubtless
knows
that
it
can
be
useful
to
the
rest
of
men
and
as
a
jealous
withholding
furnishes
him
no
enjoyment
he
communicates
it
but
even
though
he
has
the
consciousness
that
his
communication
is
highly
valuable
to
the
rest
yet
he
has
in
no
wise
sought
and
found
his
truth
for
the
sake
of
the
rest
but
for
his
own
sake
because
he
himself
desired
it
because
darkness
and
fancies
left
him
no
rest
till
he
had
procured
for
himself
light
and
enlightenment
to
the
best
of
his
powers
he
labours
therefore
for
his
own
sake
and
for
the
satisfaction
of
his
want
that
along
with
this
he
was
also
useful
to
others
yes
to
posterity
does
not
take
from
his
labour
the
egoistic
character
in
the
next
place
if
he
did
labour
only
on
his
own
account
like
the
rest
why
should
his
act
be
human
those
of
the
rest
unhuman
that
is
egoistic
perhaps
because
this
book
painting
symphony
is
the
labour
of
his
whole
being
because
he
has
done
his
best
in
it
has
spread
himself
out
wholly
and
is
wholly
to
be
known
from
it
while
the
work
of
a
handicraftsman
mirrors
only
the
handicraftsman
the
skill
in
handicraft
not
the
man
in
his
poems
we
have
the
whole
schiller
in
so
many
hundred
stoves
on
the
other
hand
we
have
before
us
only
the
stove
maker
not
the
man
but
does
this
mean
more
than
in
the
one
work
you
see
me
as
completely
as
possible
in
the
other
only
my
skill
is
it
not
me
again
that
the
act
expresses
and
is
it
not
more
egoistic
to
offer
oneself
to
the
world
in
a
work
to
work
out
and
shape
oneself
than
to
remain
concealed
behind
ones
labour
you
say
to
be
sure
that
you
are
revealing
man
but
the
man
that
you
reveal
is
you
you
reveal
only
yourself
yet
with
this
distinction
from
the
handicraftsman
q
that
he
does
not
understand
how
to
compress
himself
into
one
labour
but
in
order
to
be
known
as
himself
must
be
searched
out
in
his
other
relations
of
life
and
that
your
want
through
whose
satisfaction
that
work
came
into
being
was
a
q
theoretical
want
but
you
will
reply
that
you
reveal
quite
another
man
a
worthier
higher
greater
a
man
that
is
more
man
than
that
other
i
will
assume
that
you
accomplish
all
that
is
possible
to
man
that
you
bring
to
pass
what
no
other
succeeds
in
wherein
then
does
your
greatness
consist
precisely
in
this
that
you
are
more
than
other
men
the
masses
more
than
men
ordinarily
are
more
than
ordinary
men
precisely
in
your
elevation
above
men
you
are
distinguished
beyond
other
men
not
by
being
man
but
because
you
are
a
unique
man
doubtless
you
show
what
a
man
can
do
but
because
you
a
man
do
it
this
by
no
means
shows
that
others
also
men
are
able
to
do
as
much
you
have
executed
it
only
as
a
unique
man
and
are
unique
therein
it
is
not
man
that
makes
up
your
greatness
but
you
create
it
because
you
are
more
than
man
and
mightier
than
other
q
men
it
is
believed
that
one
cannot
be
more
than
man
rather
one
cannot
be
less
it
is
believed
further
that
whatever
one
attains
is
good
for
man
in
so
far
as
i
remain
at
all
times
a
man
q
or
like
schiller
a
swabian
like
kant
a
prussian
like
gustavus
adolphus
a
near
sighted
person
q
i
certainly
become
by
my
superior
qualities
a
notable
man
swabian
prussian
or
near
sighted
person
but
the
case
is
not
much
better
with
that
than
with
frederick
the
greats
cane
which
became
famous
for
fredericks
sake
to
give
god
the
glory
corresponds
the
modern
give
man
the
glory
but
i
mean
to
keep
it
for
myself
criticism
issuing
the
summons
to
man
to
be
human
enunciates
the
necessary
condition
of
sociability
for
only
as
a
man
among
men
is
one
companionable
herewith
it
makes
known
its
social
object
the
establishment
of
human
society
among
social
theories
criticism
is
indisputably
the
most
complete
because
it
removes
and
deprives
of
value
everything
that
separates
man
from
man
all
prerogatives
down
to
the
prerogative
of
faith
in
it
the
love
principle
of
christianity
the
true
social
principle
comes
to
the
purest
fulfilment
and
the
last
possible
experiment
is
tried
to
take
away
exclusiveness
and
repulsion
from
men
a
fight
against
egoism
in
its
simplest
and
therefore
hardest
form
in
the
form
of
singleness

exclusiveness
itself
how
can
you
live
a
truly
social
life
so
long
as
even
one
exclusiveness
still
exists
between
you
i
ask
conversely
how
can
you
be
truly
single
so
long
as
even
one
connection
still
exists
between
you
if
you
are
connected
you
cannot
leave
each
other
if
a
tie
clasps
you
you
are
something
only
with
another
and
twelve
of
you
make
a
dozen
thousands
of
you
a
people
millions
of
you
humanity
only
when
you
are
human
can
you
keep
company
with
each
other
as
men
just
as
you
can
understand
each
other
as
patriots
only
when
you
are
patriotic
all
right
then
i
answer
only
when
you
are
single
can
you
have
intercourse
with
each
other
as
what
you
are
it
is
precisely
the
keenest
critic
who
is
hit
hardest
by
the
curse
of
his
principle
putting
from
him
one
exclusive
thing
after
another
shaking
off
churchliness
patriotism
etc
he
undoes
one
tie
after
another
and
separates
himself
from
the
churchly
man
from
the
patriot
till
at
last
when
all
ties
are
undone
he
stands
q
alone
he
of
all
men
must
exclude
all
that
have
anything
exclusive
or
private
and
when
you
get
to
the
bottom
what
can
be
more
exclusive
than
the
exclusive
single
person
himself
or
does
he
perhaps
think
that
the
situation
would
be
better
if
all
became
man
and
gave
up
exclusiveness
why
for
the
very
reason
that
all
means
every
individual
the
most
glaring
contradiction
is
still
maintained
for
the
individual
is
exclusiveness
itself
if
the
humane
liberal
no
longer
concedes
to
the
individual
anything
private
or
exclusive
any
private
thought
any
private
folly
if
he
criticizes
everything
away
from
him
before
his
face
since
his
hatred
of
the
private
is
an
absolute
and
fanatical
hatred
if
he
knows
no
tolerance
toward
what
is
private
because
everything
private
is
unhuman
q
yet
he
cannot
criticize
away
the
private
person
himself
since
the
hardness
of
the
individual
person
resists
his
criticism
and
he
must
be
satisfied
with
declaring
this
person
a
private
person
and
really
leaving
everything
private
to
him
again
what
will
the
society
that
no
longer
cares
about
anything
private
do
make
the
private
impossible
no
but
subordinate
it
to
the
interests
of
society
and
e
g
leave
it
to
private
will
to
institute
holidays
as
many
as
it
chooses
if
only
it
does
not
come
in
collision
with
the
general
interest

everything
private
is
left
free
i
e
it
has
no
interest
for
society
by
their
raising
barriers
against
science
the
church
and
religiousness
have
declared
that
they
are
what
they
always
were
only
that
this
was
hidden
under
another
semblance
when
they
were
proclaimed
to
be
the
basis
and
necessary
foundation
of
the
state
a
matter
of
purely
private
concern
even
when
they
were
connected
with
the
state
and
made
it
christian
they
were
only
the
proof
that
the
state
had
not
yet
developed
its
general
political
idea
that
it
was
only
instituting
private
rights
q
they
were
only
the
highest
expression
for
the
fact
that
the
state
was
a
private
affair
and
had
to
do
only
with
private
affairs
when
the
state
shall
at
last
have
the
courage
and
strength
to
fulfil
its
general
destiny
and
to
be
free
when
therefore
it
is
also
able
to
give
separate
interests
and
private
concerns
their
true
position
q
then
religion
and
the
church
will
be
free
as
they
have
never
been
hitherto
as
a
matter
of
the
most
purely
private
concern
and
a
satisfaction
of
purely
personal
want
they
will
be
left
to
themselves
and
every
individual
every
congregation
and
ecclesiastical
communion
will
be
able
to
care
for
the
blessedness
of
their
souls
as
they
choose
and
as
they
think
necessary
every
one
will
care
for
his
souls
blessedness
so
far
as
it
is
to
him
a
personal
want
and
will
accept
and
pay
as
spiritual
caretaker
the
one
who
seems
to
him
to
offer
the
best
guarantee
for
the
satisfaction
of
his
want
science
is
at
last
left
entirely
out
of
the
game

what
is
to
happen
though
is
social
life
to
have
an
end
and
all
companionableness
all
fraternization
everything
that
is
created
by
the
love
or
society
principle
to
disappear
as
if
one
will
not
always
seek
the
other
because
he
needs
him
as
if
one
must
accommodate
himself
to
the
other
when
he
needs
him
but
the
difference
is
this
that
then
the
individual
really
unites
with
the
individual
while
formerly
they
were
bound
together
by
a
tie
son
and
father
are
bound
together
before
majority
after
it
they
can
come
together
independently
before
it
they
belonged
together
as
members
of
the
family
after
it
they
unite
as
egoists
sonship
and
fatherhood
remain
but
son
and
father
no
longer
pin
themselves
down
to
these
the
last
privilege
in
truth
is
man
with
it
all
are
privileged
or
invested
for
as
bruno
bauer
himself
says
privilege
remains
even
when
it
is
extended
to
all

thus
liberalism
runs
its
course
in
the
following
transformations
first
the
individual
is
not
man
therefore
his
individual
personality
is
of
no
account
no
personal
will
no
arbitrariness
no
orders
or
mandates
second
the
individual
has
nothing
human
therefore
no
mine
and
thine
or
property
is
valid
third
as
the
individual
neither
is
man
nor
has
anything
human
he
shall
not
exist
at
all
he
shall
as
an
egoist
with
his
egoistic
belongings
be
annihilated
by
criticism
to
make
room
for
man
man
just
discovered

but
although
the
individual
is
not
man
man
is
yet
present
in
the
individual
and
like
every
spook
and
everything
divine
has
its
existence
in
him
hence
political
liberalism
awards
to
the
individual
everything
that
pertains
to
him
as
a
man
by
birth
as
a
born
man
among
which
there
are
counted
liberty
of
conscience
the
possession
of
goods
q
in
short
the
rights
of
man
socialism
grants
to
the
individual
what
pertains
to
him
as
an
active
man
as
a
labouring
man
finally
humane
liberalism
gives
the
individual
what
he
has
as
a
man
that
is
everything
that
belongs
to
humanity
accordingly
the
single
one
has
nothing
at
all
humanity
everything
and
the
necessity
of
the
regeneration
preached
in
christianity
is
demanded
unambiguously
and
in
the
completest
measure
become
a
new
creature
become
man
one
might
even
think
himself
reminded
of
the
close
of
the
lords
prayer
to
man
belongs
the
lordship
the
power
or
dynamis
therefore
no
individual
may
be
lord
but
man
is
the
lord
of
individuals
q
mans
is
the
kingdom
the
world
consequently
the
individual
is
not
to
be
proprietor
but
man
all
command
the
world
as
property
q
to
man
is
due
renown
glorification
or
glory
doxa
from
all
for
man
or
humanity
is
the
individuals
end
for
which
he
labours
thinks
lives
and
for
whose
glorification
he
must
become
man
hitherto
men
have
always
striven
to
find
out
a
fellowship
in
which
their
inequalities
in
other
respects
should
become
nonessential
they
strove
for
equalization
consequently
for
equality
and
wanted
to
come
all
under
one
hat
which
means
nothing
less
than
that
they
were
seeking
for
one
lord
one
tie
one
faith
tis
in
one
god
we
all
believe
there
cannot
be
for
men
anything
more
fellowly
or
more
equal
than
man
himself
and
in
this
fellowship
the
love
craving
has
found
its
contentment
it
did
not
rest
till
it
had
brought
on
this
last
equalization
levelled
all
inequality
laid
man
on
the
breast
of
man
but
under
this
very
fellowship
decay
and
ruin
become
most
glaring
in
a
more
limited
fellowship
the
frenchman
still
stood
against
the
german
the
christian
against
the
mohammedan
and
so
on
now
on
the
contrary
man
stands
against
men
or
as
men
are
not
man
man
stands
against
the
un
man
the
sentence
god
has
become
man
is
now
followed
by
the
other
man
has
become
i
this
is
the
human

but
we
invert
it
and
say
i
was
not
able
to
find
myself
so
long
as
i
sought
myself
as
man
but
now
that
it
appears
that
man
is
aspiring
to
become
i
and
to
gain
a
corporeity
in
me
i
note
that
after
all
everything
depends
on
me
and
man
is
lost
without
me
but
i
do
not
care
to
give
myself
up
to
be
the
shrine
of
this
most
holy
thing
and
shall
not
ask
henceforward
whether
i
am
man
or
un
man
in
what
i
set
about
let
this
spirit
keep
off
my
neck
humane
liberalism
goes
to
work
radically
if
you
want
to
be
or
have
anything
especial
even
in
one
point
if
you
want
to
retain
for
yourself
even
one
prerogative
above
others
to
claim
even
one
right
that
is
not
a
general
right
of
man
you
are
an
egoist
very
good
i
do
not
want
to
have
or
be
anything
especial
above
others
i
do
not
want
to
claim
any
prerogative
against
them
but
q
i
do
not
measure
myself
by
others
either
and
do
not
want
to
have
any
right
whatever
i
want
to
be
all
and
have
all
that
i
can
be
and
have
whether
others
are
and
have
anything
similar
what
do
i
care
the
equal
the
same
they
can
neither
be
nor
have
i
cause
no
detriment
to
them
as
i
cause
no
detriment
to
the
rock
by
being
ahead
of
it
in
having
motion
if
they
could
have
it
they
would
have
it
to
cause
other
men
no
detriment
is
the
point
of
the
demand
to
possess
no
prerogative
to
renounce
all
being
ahead
the
strictest
theory
of
renunciation
one
is
not
to
count
himself
as
anything
especial
such
as
for
example
a
jew
or
a
christian
well
i
do
not
count
myself
as
anything
especial
but
as
unique

doubtless
i
have
similarity
with
others
yet
that
holds
good
only
for
comparison
or
reflection
in
fact
i
am
incomparable
unique
my
flesh
is
not
their
flesh
my
mind
is
not
their
mind
if
you
bring
them
under
the
generalities
flesh
mind
those
are
your
thoughts
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
my
flesh
my
mind
and
can
least
of
all
issue
a
call
to
mine
i
do
not
want
to
recognize
or
respect
in
you
any
thing
neither
the
proprietor
nor
the
ragamuffin
nor
even
the
man
but
to
use
you
in
salt
i
find
that
it
makes
food
palatable
to
me
therefore
i
dissolve
it
in
the
fish
i
recognize
an
aliment
therefore
i
eat
it
in
you
i
discover
the
gift
of
making
my
life
agreeable
therefore
i
choose
you
as
a
companion
or
in
salt
i
study
crystallization
in
the
fish
animality
in
you
men
etc
but
to
me
you
are
only
what
you
are
for
me
q
to
wit
my
object
and
because
my
object
therefore
my
property
in
humane
liberalism
ragamuffinhood
is
completed
we
must
first
come
down
to
the
most
ragamuffin
like
most
poverty
stricken
condition
if
we
want
to
arrive
at
ownness
for
we
must
strip
off
everything
alien
but
nothing
seems
more
ragamuffin
like
than
naked
q
man
it
is
more
than
ragamuffinhood
however
when
i
throw
away
man
too
because
i
feel
that
he
too
is
alien
to
me
and
that
t
can
make
no
pretensions
on
that
basis
this
is
no
longer
mere
ragamuffinhood
because
even
the
last
rag
has
fallen
off
here
stands
real
nakedness
denudation
of
everything
alien
the
ragamuffin
has
stripped
off
ragamuffinhood
itself
and
therewith
has
ceased
to
be
what
he
was
a
ragamuffin
i
am
no
longer
a
ragamuffin
but
have
been
one

up
to
this
time
the
discord
could
not
come
to
an
outbreak
because
properly
there
is
current
only
a
contention
of
modern
liberals
with
antiquated
liberals
a
contention
of
those
who
understand
freedom
in
a
small
measure
and
those
who
want
the
full
measure
of
freedom
of
the
moderate
and
measureless
therefore
everything
turns
on
the
question
how
free
must
man
be
that
man
must
be
free
in
this
all
believe
therefore
all
are
liberal
too
but
the
un
man
who
is
somewhere
in
every
individual
how
is
he
blocked
how
can
it
be
arranged
not
to
leave
the
un
man
free
at
the
same
time
with
man
liberalism
as
a
whole
has
a
deadly
enemy
an
invincible
opposite
as
god
has
the
devil
by
the
side
of
man
stands
always
the
un
man
the
individual
the
egoist
state
society
humanity
do
not
master
this
devil
humane
liberalism
has
undertaken
the
task
of
showing
the
other
liberals
that
they
still
do
not
want
freedom
if
the
other
liberals
had
before
their
eyes
only
isolated
egoism
and
were
for
the
most
part
blind
radical
liberalism
has
against
it
egoism
in
mass
throws
among
the
masses
all
who
do
not
make
the
cause
of
freedom
their
own
as
it
does
so
that
now
man
and
un
man
rigourously
separated
stand
over
against
each
other
as
enemies
to
wit
the
masses
and
criticism

namely
free
human
criticism
as
it
is
called
judenfrage
p

in
opposition
to
crude
that
is
religious
criticism
criticism
expresses
the
hope
that
it
will
be
victorious
over
all
the
masses
and
give
them
a
general
certificate
of
insolvency

so
it
means
finally
to
make
itself
out
in
the
right
and
to
represent
all
contention
of
the
faint
hearted
and
timorous
as
an
egoistic
stubbornness

as
pettiness
paltriness
all
wrangling
loses
significance
and
petty
dissensions
are
given
up
because
in
criticism
a
common
enemy
enters
the
field
you
are
egoists
altogether
one
no
better
than
another
now
the
egoists
stand
together
against
criticism
really
the
egoists
no
they
fight
against
criticism
precisely
because
it
accuses
them
of
egoism
they
do
not
plead
guilty
of
egoism
accordingly
criticism
and
the
masses
stand
on
the
same
basis
both
fight
against
egoism
both
repudiate
it
for
themselves
and
charge
it
to
each
other
criticism
and
the
masses
pursue
the
same
goal
freedom
from
egoism
and
wrangle
only
over
which
of
them
approaches
nearest
to
the
goal
or
even
attains
it
the
jews
the
christians
the
absolutists
the
men
of
darkness
and
men
of
light
politicians
communists
q
all
in
short
q
hold
the
reproach
of
egoism
far
from
them
and
as
criticism
brings
against
them
this
reproach
in
plain
terms
and
in
the
most
extended
sense
all
justify
themselves
against
the
accusation
of
egoism
and
combat
q
egoism
the
same
enemy
with
whom
criticism
wages
war
both
criticism
and
masses
are
enemies
of
egoists
and
both
seek
to
liberate
themselves
from
egoism
as
well
by
clearing
or
whitewashing
themselves
as
by
ascribing
it
to
the
opposite
party
the
critic
is
the
true
spokesman
of
the
masses
who
gives
them
the
simple
concept
and
the
phrase
of
egoism
while
the
spokesmen
to
whom
the
triumph
is
denied
were
only
bunglers

he
is
their
prince
and
general
in
the
war
against
egoism
for
freedom
what
he
fights
against
they
fight
against
but
at
the
same
time
he
is
their
enemy
too
only
not
the
enemy
before
them
but
the
friendly
enemy
who
wields
the
knout
behind
the
timorous
to
force
courage
into
them
hereby
the
opposition
of
criticism
and
the
masses
is
reduced
to
the
following
contradiction
you
are
egoists
no
we
are
not
i
will
prove
it
to
you
you
shall
have
our
justification
let
us
then
take
both
for
what
they
give
themselves
out
for
non
egoists
and
what
they
take
each
other
for
egoists
they
are
egoists
and
are
not
properly
criticism
says
you
must
liberate
your
ego
from
all
limitedness
so
entirely
that
it
becomes
a
human
ego
i
say
liberate
yourself
as
far
as
you
can
and
you
have
done
your
part
for
it
is
not
given
to
every
one
to
break
through
all
limits
or
more
expressively
not
to
every
one
is
that
a
limit
which
is
a
limit
for
the
rest
consequently
do
not
tire
yourself
with
toiling
at
the
limits
of
others
enough
if
you
tear
down
yours
who
has
ever
succeeded
in
tearing
down
even
one
limit
for
all
men
are
not
countless
persons
today
as
at
all
times
running
about
with
all
the
limitations
of
humanity
he
who
overturns
one
of
his
limits
may
have
shown
others
the
way
and
the
means
the
overturning
of
their
limits
remains
their
affair
nobody
does
anything
else
either
to
demand
of
people
that
they
become
wholly
men
is
to
call
on
them
to
cast
down
all
human
limits
that
is
impossible
because
man
has
no
limits
i
have
some
indeed
but
then
it
is
only
mine
that
concern
me
any
and
only
they
can
be
overcome
by
me
a
human
ego
i
cannot
become
just
because
i
am
i
and
not
merely
man
yet
let
us
still
see
whether
criticism
has
not
taught
us
something
that
we
can
lay
to
heart
i
am
not
free
if
i
am
not
without
interests
not
man
if
i
am
not
disinterested
well
even
if
it
makes
little
difference
to
me
to
be
free
or
man
yet
i
do
not
want
to
leave
unused
any
occasion
to
realize
myself
or
make
myself
count
criticism
offers
me
this
occasion
by
the
teaching
that
if
anything
plants
itself
firmly
in
me
and
becomes
indissoluble
i
become
its
prisoner
and
servant
a
possessed
man
an
interest
be
it
for
what
it
may
has
kidnapped
a
slave
in
me
if
i
cannot
get
away
from
it
and
is
no
longer
my
property
but
i
am
its
let
us
therefore
accept
criticisms
lesson
to
let
no
part
of
our
property
become
stable
and
to
feel
comfortable
only
in
q
dissolving
it
so
if
criticism
says
you
are
man
only
when
you
are
restlessly
criticizing
and
dissolving
then
we
say
man
i
am
without
that
and
i
am
i
likewise
therefore
i
want
only
to
be
careful
to
secure
my
property
to
myself
and
in
order
to
secure
it
i
continually
take
it
back
into
myself
annihilate
in
it
every
movement
toward
independence
and
swallow
it
before
it
can
fix
itself
and
become
a
fixed
idea
or
a
mania
but
i
do
that
not
for
the
sake
of
my
human
calling
but
because
i
call
myself
to
it
i
do
not
strut
about
dissolving
everything
that
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
dissolve
and
for
example
while
not
yet
ten
years
old
i
do
not
criticize
the
nonsense
of
the
commandments
but
i
am
man
all
the
same
and
act
humanly
in
just
this
q
that
i
still
leave
them
uncriticized
in
short
i
have
no
calling
and
follow
none
not
even
that
to
be
a
man
do
i
now
reject
what
liberalism
has
won
in
its
various
exertions
far
be
the
day
that
anything
won
should
be
lost
only
after
man
has
become
free
through
liberalism
i
turn
my
gaze
back
upon
myself
and
confess
to
myself
openly
what
man
seems
to
have
gained
i
alone
have
gained
man
is
free
when
man
is
to
man
the
supreme
being
so
it
belongs
to
the
completion
of
liberalism
that
every
other
supreme
being
be
annulled
theology
overturned
by
anthropology
god
and
his
grace
laughed
down
atheism
universal
the
egoism
of
property
has
given
up
the
last
that
it
had
to
give
when
even
the
my
god
has
become
senseless
for
god
exists
only
when
he
has
at
heart
the
individuals
welfare
as
the
latter
seeks
his
welfare
in
him
political
liberalism
abolished
the
inequality
of
masters
and
servants
it
made
people
masterless
anarchic
the
master
was
now
removed
from
the
individual
the
egoist
to
become
a
ghost
q
the
law
or
the
state
social
liberalism
abolishes
the
inequality
of
possession
of
the
poor
and
rich
and
makes
people
possessionless
or
propertyless
property
is
withdrawn
from
the
individual
and
surrendered
to
ghostly
society
humane
liberalism
makes
people
godless
atheistic
therefore
the
individuals
god
my
god
must
be
put
an
end
to
now
masterlessness
is
indeed
at
the
same
time
freedom
from
service
possessionlessness
at
the
same
time
freedom
from
care
and
godlessness
at
the
same
time
freedom
from
prejudice
for
with
the
master
the
servant
falls
away
with
possession
the
care
about
it
with
the
firmly
rooted
god
prejudice
but
since
the
master
rises
again
as
state
the
servants
appears
again
as
subject
since
possession
becomes
the
property
of
society
care
is
begotten
anew
as
labour
and
since
god
as
man
becomes
a
prejudice
there
arises
a
new
faith
faith
in
humanity
or
liberty
for
the
individuals
god
the
god
of
all
to
wit
man
is
now
exalted
for
it
is
the
highest
thing
in
us
all
to
be
man
but
as
nobody
can
become
entirely
what
the
idea
man
imports
man
remains
to
the
individual
a
lofty
other
world
an
unattained
supreme
being
a
god
but
at
the
same
time
this
is
the
true
god
because
he
is
fully
adequate
to
us
q
to
wit
our
own
self
we
ourselves
but
separated
from
us
and
lifted
above
us

postscript
the
foregoing
review
of
free
human
criticism
was
written
by
bits
immediately
after
the
appearance
of
the
books
in
question
as
was
also
that
which
elsewhere
refers
to
writings
of
this
tendency
and
i
did
little
more
than
bring
together
the
fragments
but
criticism
is
restlessly
pressing
forward
and
thereby
makes
it
necessary
for
me
to
come
back
to
it
once
more
now
that
my
book
is
finished
and
insert
this
concluding
note
i
have
before
me
the
latest
eighth
number
of
the
allgemeine
literatur
zeitung
of
bruno
bauer
there
again
the
general
interests
of
society
stand
at
the
top
but
criticism
has
reflected
and
given
this
society
a
specification
by
which
it
is
discriminated
from
a
form
which
previously
had
still
been
confused
with
it
the
state
in
former
passages
still
celebrated
as
free
state
is
quite
given
up
because
it
can
in
no
wise
fulfil
the
task
of
human
society
criticism
only
saw
itself
compelled
to
identify
for
a
moment
human
and
political
affairs
in

but
now
it
has
found
that
the
state
even
as
free
state
is
not
human
society
or
as
it
could
likewise
say
that
the
people
is
not
man
we
saw
how
it
got
through
with
theology
and
showed
clearly
that
god
sinks
into
dust
before
man
we
see
it
now
come
to
a
clearance
with
politics
in
the
same
way
and
show
that
before
man
peoples
and
nationalities
fall
so
we
see
how
it
has
its
explanation
with
church
and
state
declaring
them
both
unhuman
and
we
shall
see
q
for
it
betrays
this
to
us
already
q
how
it
can
also
give
proof
that
before
man
the
masses
which
it
even
calls
a
spiritual
being
appear
worthless
and
how
should
the
lesser
spiritual
beings
be
able
to
maintain
themselves
before
the
supreme
spirit
man
casts
down
the
false
idols
so
what
the
critic
has
in
view
for
the
present
is
the
scrutiny
of
the
masses
which
he
will
place
before
man
in
order
to
combat
them
from
the
stand
point
of
man
what
is
now
the
object
of
criticism
the
masses
a
spiritual
being
these
the
critic
will
learn
to
know
and
will
find
that
they
are
in
contradiction
with
man
he
will
demonstrate
that
they
are
unhuman
and
will
succeed
just
as
well
in
this
demonstration
as
in
the
former
ones
that
the
divine
and
the
national
or
the
concerns
of
church
and
of
state
were
the
unhuman
the
masses
are
defined
as
the
most
significant
product
of
the
revolution
as
the
deceived
multitude
which
the
illusions
of
political
illumination
and
in
general
the
entire
illumination
movement
of
the
eighteenth
century
have
given
over
to
boundless
disgruntlement
the
revolution
satisfied
some
by
its
result
and
left
others
unsatisfied
the
satisfied
part
is
the
commonalty
bourgeoisie
etc
the
unsatisfied
is
the
q
masses
does
not
the
critic
so
placed
himself
belong
to
the
masses
but
the
unsatisfied
are
still
in
great
mistiness
and
their
discontent
utters
itself
only
in
a
boundless
disgruntlement
this
the
likewise
unsatisfied
critic
now
wants
to
master
he
cannot
want
and
attain
more
than
to
bring
that
spiritual
being
the
masses
out
of
its
disgruntlement
and
to
uplift
those
who
were
only
disgruntled
to
give
them
the
right
attitude
toward
those
results
of
the
revolution
which
are
to
be
overcome
q
he
can
become
the
head
of
the
masses
their
decided
spokesman
therefore
he
wants
also
to
abolish
the
deep
chasm
which
parts
him
from
the
multitude
from
those
who
want
to
uplift
the
lower
classes
of
the
people
he
is
distinguished
by
wanting
to
deliver
from
disgruntlement
not
merely
these
but
himself
too
but
assuredly
his
consciousness
does
not
deceive
him
either
when
he
takes
the
masses
to
be
the
natural
opponents
of
theory
and
forsees
that
the
more
this
theory
shall
develop
itself
so
much
the
more
will
it
make
the
masses
compact
for
the
critic
cannot
enlighten
or
satisfy
the
masses
with
his
presupposition
man
if
over
against
the
commonalty
they
are
only
the
lower
classes
of
the
people
politically
insignificant
masses
over
against
man
they
must
still
more
be
mere
masses
humanly
insignificant
q
yes
unhuman
q
masses
or
a
multitude
of
un
men
the
critic
clears
away
everything
human
and
starting
from
the
presupposition
that
the
human
is
the
true
he
works
against
himself
denying
it
wherever
it
had
been
hitherto
found
he
proves
only
that
the
human
is
to
be
found
nowhere
except
in
his
head
but
the
unhuman
everywhere
the
unhuman
is
the
real
the
extant
on
all
hands
and
by
the
proof
that
it
is
not
human
the
critic
only
enunciates
plainly
the
tautological
sentence
that
it
is
the
unhuman
but
what
if
the
unhuman
turning
its
back
on
itself
with
resolute
heart
should
at
the
same
time
turn
away
from
the
disturbing
critic
and
leave
him
standing
untouched
and
unstung
by
his
remonstrance
you
call
me
the
unhuman
it
might
say
to
him
and
so
i
really
am
q
for
you
but
i
am
so
only
because
you
bring
me
into
opposition
to
the
human
and
i
could
despise
myself
only
so
long
as
i
let
myself
be
hypnotized
into
this
opposition
i
was
contemptible
because
i
sought
my
better
self
outside
me
i
was
the
unhuman
because
i
dreamed
of
the
human
i
resembled
the
pious
who
hunger
for
their
true
self
and
always
remain
poor
sinners
i
thought
of
myself
only
in
comparison
to
another
enough
i
was
not
all
in
all
was
not
q
unique

but
now
i
cease
to
appear
to
myself
as
the
unhuman
cease
to
measure
myself
and
let
myself
be
measured
by
man
cease
to
recognize
anything
above
me
consequently
q
adieu
humane
critic
i
only
have
been
the
unhuman
am
it
now
no
longer
but
am
the
unique
yes
to
your
loathing
the
egoistic
yet
not
the
egoistic
as
it
lets
itself
be
measured
by
the
human
humane
and
unselfish
but
the
egoistic
as
the
q
unique
we
have
to
pay
attention
to
still
another
sentence
of
the
same
number
criticism
sets
up
no
dogmas
and
wants
to
learn
to
know
nothing
but
things
the
critic
is
afraid
of
becoming
dogmatic
or
setting
up
dogmas
of
course
why
thereby
he
would
become
the
opposite
of
the
critic
q
the
dogmatist
he
would
now
become
bad
as
he
is
good
as
critic
or
would
become
from
an
unselfish
man
an
egoist
of
all
things
no
dogma
this
is
his
q
dogma
for
the
critic
remains
on
one
and
the
same
ground
with
the
dogmatist
q
that
of
thoughts
like
the
latter
he
always
starts
from
a
thought
but
varies
in
this
that
he
never
ceases
to
keep
the
principle
thought
in
the
process
of
thinking
and
so
does
not
let
it
become
stable
he
only
asserts
the
thought
process
against
the
thought
faith
the
progress
of
thinking
against
stationariness
in
it
from
criticism
no
thought
is
safe
since
criticism
is
thought
or
the
thinking
mind
itself
therefore
i
repeat
that
the
religious
world
q
and
this
is
the
world
of
thought
q
reaches
its
completion
in
criticism
where
thinking
extends
its
encroachments
over
every
thought
no
one
of
which
may
egoistically
establish
itself
where
would
the
purity
of
criticism
the
purity
of
thinking
be
left
if
even
one
thought
escaped
the
process
of
thinking
this
explains
the
fact
that
the
critic
has
even
begun
already
to
gibe
gently
here
and
there
at
the
thought
of
man
of
humanity
and
humaneness
because
he
suspects
that
here
a
thought
is
approaching
dogmatic
fixity
but
yet
he
cannot
decompose
this
thought
till
he
has
found
a
q
higher
in
which
it
dissolves
for
he
moves
only
q
in
thoughts
this
higher
thought
might
be
enunciated
as
that
of
the
movement
or
process
of
thinking
itself
as
the
thought
of
thinking
or
of
criticism
for
example
freedom
of
thinking
has
in
fact
become
complete
hereby
freedom
of
mind
celebrates
its
triumph
for
the
individual
egoistic
thoughts
have
lost
their
dogmatic
truculence
there
is
nothing
left
but
the
q
dogma
of
free
thinking
or
of
criticism
against
everything
that
belongs
to
the
world
of
thought
criticism
is
in
the
right
that
is
in
might
it
is
the
victor
criticism
and
criticism
alone
is
up
to
date
from
the
stand
point
of
thought
there
is
no
power
capable
of
being
an
overmatch
for
criticisms
and
it
is
a
pleasure
to
see
how
easily
and
sportively
this
dragon
swallows
all
other
serpents
of
thought
each
serpent
twists
to
be
sure
but
criticism
crushes
it
in
all
its
turns
i
am
no
opponent
of
criticism
i
am
no
dogmatist
and
do
not
feel
myself
touched
by
the
critics
tooth
with
which
he
tears
the
dogmatist
to
pieces
if
i
were
a
dogmatist
i
should
place
at
the
head
a
dogma
a
thought
an
idea
a
principle
and
should
complete
this
as
a
systematist
spinning
it
out
to
a
system
a
structure
of
thought
conversely
if
i
were
a
critic
an
opponent
of
the
dogmatist
i
should
carry
on
the
fight
of
free
thinking
against
the
enthralling
thought
i
should
defend
thinking
against
what
was
thought
but
i
am
neither
the
champion
of
a
thought
nor
the
champion
of
thinking
for
i
from
whom
i
start
am
not
a
thought
nor
do
i
consist
in
thinking
against
me
the
unnameable
the
realm
of
thoughts
thinking
and
mind
is
shattered
criticism
is
the
possessed
mans
fight
against
possession
as
such
against
all
possession
a
fight
which
is
founded
in
the
consciousness
that
everywhere
possession
or
as
the
critic
calls
it
a
religious
and
theological
attitude
is
extant
he
knows
that
people
stand
in
a
religious
or
believing
attitude
not
only
toward
god
but
toward
other
ideas
as
well
like
right
the
state
law
he
recognizes
possession
in
all
places
so
he
wants
to
break
up
thoughts
by
thinking
but
i
say
only
thoughtlessness
really
saves
me
from
thoughts
it
is
not
thinking
but
my
thoughtlessness
or
i
the
unthinkable
incomprehensible
that
frees
me
from
possession
a
jerk
does
me
the
service
of
the
most
anxious
thinking
a
stretching
of
the
limbs
shakes
off
the
torment
of
thoughts
a
leap
upward
hurls
from
my
breast
the
nightmare
of
the
religious
world
a
jubilant
hoopla
throws
off
year
long
burdens
but
the
monstrous
significance
of
unthinking
jubilation
could
not
be
recognized
in
the
long
night
of
thinking
and
believing
what
clumsiness
and
frivolity
to
want
to
solve
the
most
difficult
problems
acquit
yourself
of
the
most
comprehensive
tasks
by
a
breaking
off
but
have
you
tasks
if
you
do
not
set
them
to
yourself
so
long
as
you
set
them
you
will
not
give
them
up
and
i
certainly
do
not
care
if
you
think
and
thinking
create
a
thousand
thoughts
but
you
who
have
set
the
tasks
are
you
not
to
be
able
to
upset
them
again
must
you
be
bound
to
these
tasks
and
must
they
become
absolute
tasks
to
cite
only
one
thing
the
government
has
been
disparaged
on
account
of
its
resorting
to
forcible
means
against
thoughts
interfering
against
the
press
by
means
of
the
police
power
of
the
censorship
and
making
a
personal
fight
out
of
a
literary
one
as
if
it
were
solely
a
matter
of
thoughts
and
as
if
ones
attitude
toward
thoughts
must
be
unselfish
self
denying
and
self
sacrificing
do
not
those
thoughts
attack
the
governing
parties
themselves
and
so
call
out
egoism
and
do
the
thinkers
not
set
before
the
attacked
ones
the
religious
demand
to
reverence
the
power
of
thought
of
ideas
they
are
to
succumb
voluntarily
and
resignedly
because
the
divine
power
of
thought
minerva
fights
on
their
enemies
side
why
that
would
be
an
act
of
possession
a
religious
sacrifice
to
be
sure
the
governing
parties
are
themselves
held
fast
in
a
religious
bias
and
follow
the
leading
power
of
an
idea
or
a
faith
but
they
are
at
the
same
time
unconfessed
egoists
and
right
here
against
the
enemy
their
pent
up
egoism
breaks
loose
possessed
in
their
faith
they
are
at
the
same
time
unpossessed
by
their
opponents
faith
they
are
egoists
toward
this
if
one
wants
to
make
them
a
reproach
it
could
only
be
the
converse
q
to
wit
that
they
are
possessed
by
their
ideas
against
thoughts
no
egoistic
power
is
to
appear
no
police
power
and
the
like
so
the
believers
in
thinking
believe
but
thinking
and
its
thoughts
are
not
sacred
to
me
and
i
defend
my
skin
against
them
as
against
other
things
that
may
be
an
unreasonable
defense
but
if
i
am
in
duty
bound
to
reason
then
i
like
abraham
must
sacrifice
my
dearest
to
it
in
the
kingdom
of
thought
which
like
that
of
faith
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
every
one
is
assuredly
wrong
who
uses
unthinking
force
just
as
every
one
is
wrong
who
in
the
kingdom
of
love
behaves
unlovingly
or
although
he
is
a
christian
and
therefore
lives
in
the
kingdom
of
love
yet
acts
un
christianly
in
these
kingdoms
to
which
he
supposes
himself
to
belong
though
he
nevertheless
throws
off
their
laws
he
is
a
sinner
or
egoist
but
it
is
only
when
he
he
becomes
a
criminal
against
these
kingdoms
that
he
can
throw
off
their
dominion
here
too
the
result
is
this
that
the
fight
of
the
thinkers
against
the
government
is
indeed
in
the
right
namely
in
might
q
so
far
as
it
is
carried
on
against
the
governments
thoughts
the
government
is
dumb
and
does
not
succeed
in
making
any
literary
rejoinder
to
speak
of
but
is
on
the
other
hand
in
the
wrong
to
wit
in
impotence
so
far
as
it
does
not
succeed
in
bringing
into
the
field
anything
but
thoughts
against
a
personal
power
the
egoistic
power
stops
the
mouths
of
the
thinkers
the
theoretical
fight
cannot
complete
the
victory
and
the
sacred
power
of
thought
succumbs
to
the
might
of
egoism
only
the
egoistic
fight
the
fight
of
egoists
on
both
sides
clears
up
everything
this
last
now
to
make
thinking
an
affair
of
egoistic
option
an
affair
of
the
single
person

a
mere
pastime
or
hobby
as
it
were
and
to
take
from
it
the
importance
of
being
the
last
decisive
power
this
degradation
and
desecration
of
thinking
this
equalization
of
the
unthinking
and
thoughtful
ego
this
clumsy
but
real
equality
q
criticism
is
not
able
to
produce
because
it
itself
is
only
the
priest
of
thinking
and
sees
nothing
beyond
thinking
but
q
the
deluge
criticism
does
indeed
affirm
that
free
criticism
may
overcome
the
state
but
at
the
same
time
it
defends
itself
against
the
reproach
which
is
laid
upon
it
by
the
state
government
that
it
is
self
will
and
impudence
it
thinks
then
that
self
will
and
impudence
may
not
overcome
it
alone
may
the
truth
is
rather
the
reverse
the
state
can
be
really
overcome
only
by
impudent
self
will
it
may
now
to
conclude
with
this
be
clear
that
in
the
critics
new
change
of
front
he
has
not
transformed
himself
but
only
made
good
an
oversight
disentangled
a
subject
and
is
saying
too
much
when
he
speaks
of
criticism
criticizing
itself
it
or
rather
he
has
only
criticized
its
oversight
and
cleared
it
of
its
inconsistencies
if
he
wanted
to
criticize
criticism
he
would
have
to
look
and
see
if
there
was
anything
in
its
presupposition
i
on
my
part
start
from
a
presupposition
in
presupposing
myself
but
my
presupposition
does
not
struggle
for
its
perfection
like
man
struggling
for
his
perfection
but
only
serves
me
to
enjoy
it
and
consume
it
i
consume
my
presupposition
and
nothing
else
and
exist
only
in
consuming
it
but
that
presupposition
is
therefore
not
a
presupposition
at
all
for
as
i
am
the
unique
i
know
nothing
of
the
duality
of
a
presupposing
and
a
presupposed
ego
an
incomplete
and
a
complete
ego
or
man
but
this
that
i
consume
myself
means
only
that
i
am
i
do
not
presuppose
myself
because
i
am
every
moment
just
positing
or
creating
myself
and
am
i
only
by
being
not
presupposed
but
posited
and
again
posited
only
in
the
moment
when
i
posit
myself
that
is
i
am
creator
and
creature
in
one
if
the
presuppositions
that
have
hitherto
been
current
are
to
melt
away
in
a
full
dissolution
they
must
not
be
dissolved
into
a
higher
presupposition
again
q
a
thought
or
thinking
itself
criticism
for
that
dissolution
is
to
be
for
my
good
otherwise
it
would
belong
only
in
the
series
of
the
innumerable
dissolutions
which
in
favour
of
others
as
this
very
man
god
the
state
pure
morality
etc
declared
old
truths
to
be
untruths
and
did
away
with
long
fostered
presuppositions

you
call

a

what
do
you
want
to
become
free
from
then
from
your
hardtack
and
your
straw
bed
then
throw
them
away
q
but
that
seems
not
to
serve
you
you
want
rather
to
have
the
freedom
to
enjoy
delicious
foods
and
downy
beds
are
men
to
give
you
this
freedom
q
are
they
to
permit
it
to
you
you
do
not
hope
that
from
their
philanthropy
because
you
know
they
all
think
like
you
each
is
the
nearest
to
himself
how
therefore
do
you
mean
to
come
to
the
enjoyment
of
those
foods
and
beds
evidently
not
otherwise
than
in
making
them
your
property
if
you
think
it
over
rightly
you
do
not
want
the
freedom
to
have
all
these
fine
things
for
with
this
freedom
you
still
do
not
have
them
you
want
really
to
have
them
to
call
them
yours
and
possess
them
as
your
property
of
what
use
is
a
freedom
to
you
indeed
if
it
brings
in
nothing
and
if
you
became
free
from
everything
you
would
no
longer
have
anything
for
freedom
is
empty
of
substance
whoso
knows
not
how
to
make
use
of
it
for
him
it
has
no
value
this
useless
permission
but
how
i
make
use
of
it
depends
on
my
personality

i
have
no
objection
to
freedom
but
i
wish
more
than
freedom
for
you
you
should
not
merely
be
rid
of
what
you
do
not
want
you
should
not

be

you
should
be
an
owner
too
free
q
from
what
oh
what
is
there
that
cannot
be
shaken
off
the
yoke
of
serfdom
of

of

the

yes
even
the
dominion
of

of

for

completest

is
nothing

q
freedom

from

from

and
the

for

as
for

worthy

deprived

of

it

however
the

a
problem
whose
obscurity
disturbed
my
mind
at
once
there
await
me
innumerable
others
whose
perplexities
impede
my
progress
dim
my
free
gaze
make
the
limits
of
my
freedom
painfully
sensible
to
me
now
that
you
have
become
free
from
sin
you
have
become
servants
of
righteousness

republicans
in
their
broad
freedom
do
they
not
become
servants
of
the
law
how
true
christian
hearts
at
all
times
longed
to
become
free
how
they
pined
to
see
themselves
delivered
from
the
bonds
of
this
earth
life
they
looked
out
toward
the
land
of
freedom
the
jerusalem
that
is
above
is
the
freewoman
she
is
the
mother
of
us
all
gal


being
free
from
anything
q
means
only
being
clear
or
rid
he
is
free
from
headache
is
equal
to
he
is
rid
of
it
he
is
free
from
this
prejudice
is
equal
to
he
has
never
conceived
it
or
he
has
got
rid
of
it
in
less
we
complete
the
freedom
recommended
by
christianity
in
sinless
godless
moralityless
etc
freedom
is
the
doctrine
of
christianity
ye
dear
brethren
are
called
to
freedom

so
speak
and
so
do
as
those
who
are
to
be
judged
by
the
law
of
freedom

must
we
then
because
freedom
betrays
itself
as
a
christian
ideal
give
it
up
no
nothing
is
to
be
lost
freedom
no
more
than
the
rest
but
it
is
to
become
our
own
and
in
the
form
of
freedom
it
cannot
what
a
difference
between
freedom
and
ownness
one
can
get
rid
of
a
great
many
things
one
yet
does
not
get
rid
of
all
one
becomes
free
from
much
not
from
everything
inwardly
one
may
be
free
in
spite
of
the
condition
of
slavery
although
too
it
is
again
only
from
all
sorts
of
things
not
from
everything
but
from
the
whip
the
domineering
temper
of
the
master
one
does
not
as
slave
become
free
freedom
lives
only
in
the
realm
of
dreams

ownness
on
the
contrary
is
my
whole
being
and
existence
it
is
i
myself
i
am
free
from
what
i
am
rid
of
owner
of
what
i
have
in
my
power
or
what
i
control
my
own
i
am
at
all
times
and
under
all
circumstances
if
i
know
how
to
have
myself
and
do
not
throw
myself
away
on
others
to
be
free
is
something
that
i
cannot
truly
will
because
i
cannot
make
it
cannot
create
it
i
can
only
wish
it
and
q
aspire
toward
it
for
it
remains
an
ideal
a
spook
the
fetters
of
reality
cut
the
sharpest
welts
in
my
flesh
every
moment
but
my
own
i
remain
given
up
as
serf
to
a
master
i
think
only
of
myself
and
my
advantage
his
blows
strike
me
indeed
i
am
not
free
from
them
but
i
endure
them
only
for
my
benefit
perhaps
in
order
to
deceive
him
and
make
him
secure
by
the
semblance
of
patience
or
again
not
to
draw
worse
upon
myself
by
contumacy
but
as
i
keep
my
eye
on
myself
and
my
selfishness
i
take
by
the
forelock
the
first
good
opportunity
to
trample
the
slaveholder
into
the
dust
that
i
then
become
free
from
him
and
his
whip
is
only
the
consequence
of
my
antecedent
egoism
here
one
perhaps
says
i
was
free
even
in
the
condition
of
slavery
q
to
wit
intrinsically
or
inwardly
but
intrinsically
free
is
not
really
free
and
inwardly
is
not
outwardly
i
was
own
on
the
other
hand
my
own
altogether
inwardly
and
outwardly
under
the
dominion
of
a
cruel
master
my
body
is
not
free
from
torments
and
lashes
but
it
is
my
bones
that
moan
under
the
torture
my
fibres
that
quiver
under
the
blows
and
i
moan
because
my
body
moans
that
i
sigh
and
shiver
proves
that
i
have
not
yet
lost
myself
that
i
am
still
my
own
my
leg
is
not
free
from
the
masters
stick
but
it
is
my
leg
and
is
inseparable
let
him
tear
it
off
me
and
look
and
see
if
he
still
has
my
leg
he
retains
in
his
hand
nothing
but
the
q
corpse
of
my
leg
which
is
as
little
my
leg
as
a
dead
dog
is
still
a
dog
a
dog
has
a
pulsating
heart
a
so
called
dead
dog
has
none
and
is
therefore
no
longer
a
dog
if
one
opines
that
a
slave
may
yet
be
inwardly
free
he
says
in
fact
only
the
most
indisputable
and
trivial
thing
for
who
is
going
to
assert
that
any
man
is
wholly
without
freedom
if
i
am
an
eye
servant
can
i
therefore
not
be
free
from
innumerable
things
from
faith
in
zeus
from
the
desire
for
fame
and
the
like
why
then
should
not
a
whipped
slave
also
be
able
to
be
inwardly
free
from
un
christian
sentiments
from
hatred
of
his
enemy
etc
he
then
has
christian
freedom
is
rid
of
the
un
christian
but
has
he
absolute
freedom
freedom
from
everything
as
from
the
christian
delusion
or
from
bodily
pain
in
the
meantime
all
this
seems
to
be
said
more
against
names
than
against
the
thing
but
is
the
name
indifferent
and
has
not
a
word
a
shibboleth
always
inspired
and
q
fooled
men
yet
between
freedom
and
ownness
there
lies
still
a
deeper
chasm
than
the
mere
difference
of
the
words
all
the
world
desires
freedom
all
long
for
its
reign
to
come
oh
enchantingly
beautiful
dream
of
a
blooming
reign
of
freedom
a
free
human
race
q
who
has
not
dreamed
it
so
men
shall
become
free
entirely
free
free
from
all
constraint
from
all
constraint
really
from
all
are
they
never
to
put
constraint
on
themselves
any
more
oh
yes
that
of
course
dont
you
see
that
is
no
constraint
at
all
well
then
at
any
rate
they
are
to
become
free
from
religious
faith
from
the
strict
duties
of
morality
from
the
inexorability
of
the
law
from
q
what
a
fearful
misunderstanding
well
what
are
they
to
be
free
from
then
and
what
not
the
lovely
dream
is
dissipated
awakened
one
rubs
his
half
opened
eyes
and
stares
at
the
prosaic
questioner
what
men
are
to
be
free
from
q
from
blind
credulity
cries
one
whats
that
exclaims
another
all
faith
is
blind
credulity
they
must
become
free
from
all
faith
no
no
for
gods
sake
q
inveighs
the
first
again
q
do
not
cast
all
faith
from
you
else
the
power
of
brutality
breaks
in
we
must
have
the
republic
q
a
third
makes
himself
heard
q
and
become
q
free
from
all
commanding
lords
there
is
no
help
in
that
says
a
fourth
we
only
get
a
new
lord
then
a
dominant
majority
let
us
rather
free
ourselves
from
this
dreadful
inequality
q
o
hapless
equality
already
i
hear
your
plebeian
roar
again
how
i
had
dreamed
so
beautifully
just
now
of
a
paradise
of
freedom
and
what
q
impudence
and
licentiousness
now
raises
its
wild
clamour
thus
the
first
laments
and
gets
on
his
feet
to
grasp
the
sword
against
unmeasured
freedom
soon
we
no
longer
hear
anything
but
the
clashing
of
the
swords
of
the
disagreing
dreamers
of
freedom
what
the
craving
for
freedom
has
always
come
to
has
been
the
desire
for
a
particular
freedom
such
as
freedom
of
faith
the
believing
man
wanted
to
be
free
and
independent
of
what
of
faith
perhaps
no
but
of
the
inquisitors
of
faith
so
now
political
or
civil
freedom
the
citizen
wants
to
become
free
not
from
citizenhood
but
from
bureaucracy
the
arbitrariness
of
princes
and
the
like
prince
metternich
once
said
he
had
found
a
way
that
was
adapted
to
guide
men
in
the
path
of
genuine
freedom
for
all
the
future
the
count
of
provence
ran
away
from
france
precisely
at
the
time
when
she
was
preparing
the
reign
of
freedom
and
said
my
imprisonment
had
become
intolerable
to
me
i
had
only
one
passion
the
desire
for
freedom
i
thought
only
of
it
the
craving
for
a
particular
freedom
always
includes
the
purpose
of
a
new
dominion
as
it
was
with
the
revolution
which
indeed
could
give
its
defenders
the
uplifting
feeling
that
they
were
fighting
for
freedom
but
in
truth
only
because
they
were
after
a
particular
freedom
therefore
a
new
dominion
the
dominion
of
the
law
freedom
you
all
want
you
want
freedom
why
then
do
you
haggle
over
a
more
or
less
freedom
can
only
be
the
whole
of
freedom
a
piece
of
freedom
is
not
freedom
you
despair
of
the
possibility
of
obtaining
the
whole
of
freedom
freedom
from
everything
q
yes
you
consider
it
insanity
even
to
wish
this
q
well
then
leave
off
chasing
after
the
phantom
and
spend
your
pains
on
something
better
than
the
unattainable
ah
but
there
is
nothing
better
than
freedom
what
have
you
then
when
you
have
freedom
q
for
i
will
not
speak
here
of
your
piecemeal
bits
of
freedom
q
complete
freedom
then
you
are
rid
of
everything
that
embarrasses
you
everything
and
there
is
probably
nothing
that
does
not
once
in
your
life
embarrass
you
and
cause
you
inconvenience
and
for
whose
sake
then
did
you
want
to
be
rid
of
it
doubtless
for
your
sake
because
it
is
in
your
way
but
if
something
were
not
inconvenient
to
you
if
on
the
contrary
it
were
quite
to
your
mind
such
as
the
gently
but
irresistibly
commanding
look
of
your
loved
one
q
then
you
would
not
want
to
be
rid
of
it
and
free
from
it
why
not
for
your
sake
again
so
you
take
yourselves
as
measure
and
judge
over
all
you
gladly
let
freedom
go
when
unfreedom
the
sweet
service
of
love
suits
you
and
you
take
up
your
freedom
again
on
occasion
when
it
begins
to
suit
you
better
q
that
is
supposing
which
is
not
the
point
here
that
you
are
not
afraid
of
such
a
repeal
of
the
union
for
other
perhaps
religious
reasons
why
will
you
not
take
courage
now
to
really
make
yourselves
the
central
point
and
the
main
thing
altogether
why
grasp
in
the
air
at
freedom
your
dream
are
you
your
dream
do
not
begin
by
inquiring
of
your
dreams
your
notions
your
thoughts
for
that
is
all
hollow
theory
ask
yourselves
and
ask
after
yourselves
q
that
is
practical
and
you
know
you
want
very
much
to
be
practical
but
there
the
one
hearkens
what
his
god
of
course
what
he
thinks
of
at
the
name
god
is
his
god
may
be
going
to
say
to
it
and
another
what
his
moral
feelings
his
conscience
his
feeling
of
duty
may
determine
about
it
and
a
third
calculates
what
folks
will
think
of
it
q
and
when
each
has
thus
asked
his
lord
god
folks
are
a
lord
god
just
as
good
as
nay
even
more
compact
than
the
other
worldly
and
imaginary
one
vox
populi
vox
dei
then
he
accommodates
himself
to
his
lords
will
and
listens
no
more
at
all
for
what
he
himself
would
like
to
say
and
decide
therefore
turn
to
yourselves
rather
than
to
your
gods
or
idols
bring
out
from
yourselves
what
is
in
you
bring
it
to
the
light
bring
yourselves
to
revelation
how
one
acts
only
from
himself
and
asks
after
nothing
further
the
christians
have
realized
in
the
notion
god
he
acts
as
it
pleases
him
and
foolish
man
who
could
do
just
so
is
to
act
as
it
pleases
god
instead
q
if
it
is
said
that
even
god
proceeds
according
to
eternal
laws
that
too
fits
me
since
i
too
cannot
get
out
of
my
skin
but
have
my
law
in
my
whole
nature
in
myself
but
one
needs
only
admonish
you
of
yourselves
to
bring
you
to
despair
at
once
what
am
i
each
of
you
asks
himself
an
abyss
of
lawless
and
unregulated
impulses
desires
wishes
passions
a
chaos
without
light
or
guiding
star
how
am
i
to
obtain
a
correct
answer
if
without
regard
to
gods
commandments
or
to
the
duties
which
morality
prescribes
without
regard
to
the
voice
of
reason
which
in
the
course
of
history
after
bitter
experiences
has
exalted
the
best
and
most
reasonable
thing
into
law
i
simply
appeal
to
myself
my
passion
would
advise
me
to
do
the
most
senseless
thing
possible
q
thus
each
deems
himself
the
q
devil
for
if
so
far
as
he
is
unconcerned
about
religion
he
only
deemed
himself
a
beast
he
would
easily
find
that
the
beast
which
does
follow
only
its
impulse
as
it
were
its
advice
does
not
advise
and
impel
itself
to
do
the
most
senseless
things
but
takes
very
correct
steps
but
the
habit
of
the
religious
way
of
thinking
has
biased
our
mind
so
grievously
that
we
are
q
terrified
at
ourselves
in
our
nakedness
and
naturalness
it
has
degraded
us
so
that
we
deem
ourselves
depraved
by
nature
born
devils
of
course
it
comes
into
your
head
at
once
that
your
calling
requires
you
to
do
the
good
the
moral
the
right
now
if
you
ask
yourselves
what
is
to
be
done
how
can
the
right
voice
sound
forth
from
you
the
voice
which
points
the
way
of
the
good
the
right
the
true
what
concord
have
god
and
belial
but
what
would
you
think
if
one
answered
you
by
saying
that
one
is
to
listen
to
god
conscience
duties
laws
and
so
forth
is
flim
flam
with
which
people
have
stuffed
your
head
and
heart
and
made
you
crazy
and
if
he
asked
you
how
it
is
that
you
know
so
surely
that
the
voice
of
nature
is
a
seducer
and
if
he
even
demanded
of
you
to
turn
the
thing
about
and
actually
to
deem
the
voice
of
god
and
conscience
to
be
the
devils
work
there
are
such
graceless
men
how
will
you
settle
them
you
cannot
appeal
to
your
parsons
parents
and
good
men
for
precisely
these
are
designated
by
them
as
your
seducers
as
the
true
seducers
and
corrupters
of
youth
who
busily
sow
broadcast
the
tares
of
self
contempt
and
reverence
to
god
who
fill
young
hearts
with
mud
and
young
heads
with
stupidity
but
now
those
people
go
on
and
ask
for
whose
sake
do
you
care
about
gods
and
the
other
commandments
you
surely
do
not
suppose
that
this
is
done
merely
out
of
complaisance
toward
god
no
you
are
doing
it
q
for
your
sake
again
q
here
too
therefore
you
are
the
main
thing
and
each
must
say
to
himself
i
am
everything
to
myself
and
i
do
everything
on
my
account
if
it
ever
became
clear
to
you
that
god
the
commandments
and
so
on
only
harm
you
that
they
reduce
and
ruin
you
to
a
certainty
you
would
throw
them
from
you
just
as
the
christians
once
condemned
apollo
or
minerva
or
heathen
morality
they
did
indeed
put
in
the
place
of
these
christ
and
afterward
mary
as
well
as
a
christian
morality
but
they
did
this
for
the
sake
of
their
souls
welfare
too
therefore
out
of
egoism
or
ownness
and
it
was
by
this
egoism
this
ownness
that
they
got
rid
of
the
old
world
of
gods
and
became
free
from
it
ownness
created
a
new
freedom
for
ownness
is
the
creator
of
everything
as
genius
a
definite
ownness
which
is
always
originality
has
for
a
long
time
already
been
looked
upon
as
the
creator
of
new
productions
that
have
a
place
in
the
history
of
the
world
if
your
efforts
are
ever
to
make
freedom
the
issue
then
exhaust
freedoms
demands
who
is
it
that
is
to
become
free
you
i
we
free
from
what
from
everything
that
is
not
you
not
i
not
we
i
therefore
am
the
kernel
that
is
to
be
delivered
from
all
wrappings
and
q
freed
from
all
cramping
shells
what
is
left
when
i
have
been
freed
from
everything
that
is
not
i
only
i
nothing
but
i
but
freedom
has
nothing
to
offer
to
this
i
himself
as
to
what
is
now
to
happen
further
after
i
have
become
free
freedom
is
silent
q
as
our
governments
when
the
prisoners
time
is
up
merely
let
him
go
thrusting
him
out
into
abandonment
now
why
if
freedom
is
striven
after
for
love
of
the
i
after
all
q
why
not
choose
the
i
himself
as
beginning
middle
and
end
am
i
not

more
than

is
it
not
i
that
make
myself
free
am
not
i
the

even
unfree
even
laid
in
a
thousand
fetters
i
yet
am
and
i
am
not
like
freedom
extant
only
in
the
future
and
in
hopes
but
even
as
the
most
abject
of
slaves
i
am
q
present
think
that
over
well
and
decide
whether
you
will
place
on
your
banner
the
dream
of
freedom
or
the
resolution
of
egoism
of
ownness
freedom
awakens
your
rage
against
everything
that
is
not
you
egoism
calls
you
to
joy
over
yourselves
to
self
enjoyment
freedom
is
and
remains
a
longing
a
romantic
plaint
a
christian
hope
for
unearthliness
and
futurity
ownness
is
a
reality
which
of
ifself
removes
just
so
much
unfreedom
as
by
barring
your
own
way
hinders
you
what
does
not
disturb
you
you
will
not
want
to
renounce
and
if
it
begins
to
disturb
you
why
you
know
that
you
must
obey
yourselves
rather
than
men
freedom
teaches
only
get
yourselves
rid
relieve
yourselves
of
everything
burdensome
it
does
not
teach
you
who
you
yourselves
are
rid
rid
so
call
get
rid
even
of
yourselves
deny
yourselves
but
ownness
calls
you
back
to
yourselves
it
says
come
to
yourself
under
the
aegis
of
freedom
you
get
rid
of
many
kinds
of
things
but
something
new
pinches
you
again
you
are
rid
of
the
evil
one
evil
is
left

as
own
you
are
really
rid
of
everything
and
what
clings
to
you
you
have
accepted
it
is
your
choice
and
your
pleasure
the
own
man
is
the
free
born
the
man
free
to
begin
with
the
free
man
on
the
contrary
is
only
the
eleutheromaniac
the
dreamer
and
enthusiast
the
former
is
originally
free
because
he
recognizes
nothing
but
himself
he
does
not
need
to
free
himself
first
because
at
the
start
he
rejects
everything
outside
himself
because
he
prizes
nothing
more
than
himself
rates
nothing
higher
because
in
short
he
starts
from
himself
and
comes
to
himself
constrained
by
childish
respect
he
is
nevertheless
already
working
at
freeing
himself
from
this
constraint
ownness
works
in
the
little
egoist
and
procures
him
the
desired
q
freedom
thousands
of
years
of
civilization
have
obscured
to
you
what
you
are
have
made
you
believe
you
are
not
egoists
but
are
called
to
be
idealists
good
men
shake
that
off
do
not
seek
for
freedom
which
does
precisely
deprive
you
of
yourselves
in
self
denial
but
seek
for
yourselves
become
egoists
become
each
of
you
an
almighty
ego
or
more
clearly
just
recognize
yourselves
again
just
recognize
what
you
really
are
and
let
go
your
hypocritical
endeavours
your
foolish
mania
to
be
something
else
than
you
are
hypocritical
i
call
them
because
you
have
yet
remained
egoists
all
these
thousands
of
years
but
sleeping
self
deceiving
crazy
egoists
you
heautontimorumenoses
you
self
tormentors
never
yet
has
a
religion
been
able
to
dispense
with
promises
whether
they
referred
us
to
the
other
world
or
to
this
long
life
etc
for
man
is
mercenary
and
does
nothing
gratis
but
how
about
that
doing
the
good
for
the
goods
sake
without
prospect
of
reward
as
if
here
too
the
pay
was
not
contained
in
the
satisfaction
that
it
is
to
afford
even
religion
therefore
is
founded
on
our
egoism
and
q
exploits
it
calculated
for
our
desires
it
stifles
many
others
for
the
sake
of
one
this
then
gives
the
phenomenon
of
cheated
egoism
where
i
satisfy
not
myself
but
one
of
my
desires
such
as
the
impulse
toward
blessedness
religion
promises
me
the
q
supreme
good
to
gain
this
i
no
longer
regard
any
other
of
my
desires
and
do
not
slake
them
q
all
your
doings
are
unconfessed
secret
covert
and
concealed
egoism
but
because
they
are
egoism
that
you
are
unwilling
to
confess
to
yourselves
that
you
keep
secret
from
yourselves
hence
not
manifest
and
public
egoism
consequently
unconscious
egoism
q
therefore
they
are
not
egoism
but
thraldom
service
self
renunciation
you
are
egoists
and
you
are
not
since
you
renounce
egoism
where
you
seem
most
to
be
such
you
have
drawn
upon
the
word
egoist
q
loathing
and
contempt
i
secure
my
freedom
with
regard
to
the
world
in
the
degree
that
i
make
the
world
my
own
gain
it
and
take
possession
of
it
for
myself
by
whatever
might
by
that
of
persuasion
of
petition
of
categorical
demand
yes
even
by
hypocrisy
cheating
etc
for
the
means
that
i
use
for
it
are
determined
by
what
i
am
if
i
am
weak
i
have
only
weak
means
like
the
aforesaid
which
yet
are
good
enough
for
a
considerable
part
of
the
world
besides
cheating
hypocrisy
lying
look
worse
than
they
are
who
has
not
cheated
the
police
the
law
who
has
not
quickly
taken
on
an
air
of
honourable
loyalty
before
the
sheriffs
officer
who
meets
him
in
order
to
conceal
an
illegality
that
may
have
been
committed
he
who
has
not
done
it
has
simply
let
violence
be
done
to
him
he
was
a
weakling
from
q
conscience
i
know
that
my
freedom
is
diminished
even
by
my
not
being
able
to
carry
out
my
will
on
another
object
be
this
other
something
without
will
like
a
rock
or
something
with
will
like
a
government
an
individual
i
deny
my
ownness
when
q
in
presence
of
another
q
i
give
myself
up
give
way
desist
submit
therefore
by
loyalty
submission
for
it
is
one
thing
when
i
give
up
my
previous
course
because
it
does
not
lead
to
the
goal
and
therefore
turn
out
of
a
wrong
road
it
is
another
when
i
yield
myself
a
prisoner
i
get
around
a
rock
that
stands
in
my
way
till
i
have
powder
enough
to
blast
it
i
get
around
the
laws
of
a
people
till
i
have
gathered
strength
to
overthrow
them
because
i
cannot
grasp
the
moon
is
it
therefore
to
be
sacred
to
me
an
astarte
if
i
only
could
grasp
you
i
surely
would
and
if
i
only
find
a
means
to
get
up
to
you
you
shall
not
frighten
me
you
inapprehensible
one
you
shall
remain
inapprehensible
to
me
only
till
i
have
acquired
the
might
for
apprehension
and
call
you
my
own
i
do
not
give
myself
up
before
you
but
only
bide
my
time
even
if
for
the
present
i
put
up
with
my
inability
to
touch
you
i
yet
remember
it
against
you
vigorous
men
have
always
done
so
when
the
loyal
had
exalted
an
unsubdued
power
to
be
their
master
and
had
adored
it
when
they
had
demanded
adoration
from
all
then
there
came
some
such
son
of
nature
who
would
not
loyally
submit
and
drove
the
adored
power
from
its
inaccessible
olympus
he
cried
his
stand
still
to
the
rolling
sun
and
made
the
earth
go
round
the
loyal
had
to
make
the
best
of
it
he
laid
his
axe
to
the
sacred
oaks
and
the
loyal
were
astonished
that
no
heavenly
fire
consumed
him
he
threw
the
pope
off
peters
chair
and
the
loyal
had
no
way
to
hinder
it
he
is
tearing
down
the
divine
right
business
and
the
loyal
croak
in
vain
and
at
last
are
silent
my
freedom
becomes
complete
only
when
it
is
my
q
might
but
by
this
i
cease
to
be
a
merely
free
man
and
become
an
own
man
why
is
the
freedom
of
the
peoples
a
hollow
word
because
the
peoples
have
no
might
with
a
breath
of
the
living
ego
i
blow
peoples
over
be
it
the
breath
of
a
nero
a
chinese
emperor
or
a
poor
writer
why
is
it
that
the
g

legislatures
pine
in
vain
for
freedom
and
are
lectured
for
it
by
the
cabinet
ministers
because
they
are
not
of
the
mighty
might
is
a
fine
thing
and
useful
for
many
purposes
for
one
goes
further
with
a
handful
of
might
than
with
a
bagful
of
right
you
long
for
freedom
you
fools
if
you
took
might
freedom
would
come
of
itself
see
he
who
has
might
stands
above
the
law
how
does
this
prospect
taste
to
you
you
law
abiding
people
but
you
have
no
taste
the
cry
for
freedom
rings
loudly
all
around
but
is
it
felt
and
known
what
a
donated
or
chartered
freedom
must
mean
it
is
not
recognized
in
the
full
amplitude
of
the
word
that
all
freedom
is
essentially
q
self
liberation
q
that
i
can
have
only
so
much
freedom
as
i
procure
for
myself
by
my
ownness
of
what
use
is
it
to
sheep
that
no
one
abridges
their
freedom
of
speech
they
stick
to
bleating
give
one
who
is
inwardly
a
mohammedan
a
jew
or
a
christian
permission
to
speak
what
he
likes
he
will
yet
utter
only
narrow
minded
stuff
if
on
the
contrary
certain
others
rob
you
of
the
freedom
of
speaking
and
hearing
they
know
quite
rightly
wherein
lies
their
temporary
advantage
as
you
would
perhaps
be
able
to
say
and
hear
something
whereby
those
certain
persons
would
lose
their
credit
if
they
nevertheless
give
you
freedom
they
are
simply
knaves
who
give
more
than
they
have
for
then
they
give
you
nothing
of
their
own
but
stolen
wares
they
give
you
your
own
freedom
the
freedom
that
you
must
take
for
yourselves
and
they
give
it
to
you
only
that
you
may
not
take
it
and
call
the
thieves
and
cheats
to
an
account
to
boot
in
their
slyness
they
know
well
that
given
chartered
freedom
is
no
freedom
since
only
the
freedom
one
takes
for
himself
therefore
the
egoists
freedom
rides
with
full
sails
donated
freedom
strikes
its
sails
as
soon
as
there
comes
a
storm
q
or
calm
it
requires
always
a
q
gentle
and
moderate
breeze
here
lies
the
difference
between
self
liberation
and
emancipation
manumission
setting
free
those
who
today
stand
in
the
opposition
are
thirsting
and
screaming
to
be
set
free
the
princes
are
to
declare
their
peoples
of
age
that
is
emancipate
them
behave
as
if
you
were
of
age
and
you
are
so
without
any
declaration
of
majority
if
you
do
not
behave
accordingly
you
are
not
worthy
of
it
and
would
never
be
of
age
even
by
a
declaration
of
majority
when
the
greeks
were
of
age
they
drove
out
their
tyrants
and
when
the
son
is
of
age
he
makes
himself
independent
of
his
father
if
the
greeks
had
waited
till
their
tyrants
graciously
allowed
them
their
majority
they
might
have
waited
long
a
sensible
father
throws
out
a
son
who
will
not
come
of
age
and
keeps
the
house
to
himself
it
serves
the
noodle
right
the
man
who
is
set
free
is
nothing
but
a
freed
man
a
libertinus
a
dog
dragging
a
piece
of
chain
with
him
he
is
an
unfree
man
in
the
garment
of
freedom
like
the
ass
in
the
lions
skin
emancipated
jews
are
nothing
bettered
in
themselves
but
only
relieved
as
jews
although
he
who
relieves
their
condition
is
certainly
more
than
a
churchly
christian
as
the
latter
cannot
do
this
without
inconsistency
but
emancipated
or
not
emancipated
jew
remains
jew
he
who
is
not
self
freed
is
merely
an
q
emancipated
man
the
protestant
state
can
certainly
set
free
emancipate
the
catholics
but
because
they
do
not
make
themselves
free
they
remain
simply
q
catholics
selfishness
and
unselfishness
have
already
been
spoken
of
the
friends
of
freedom
are
exasperated
against
selfishness
because
in
their
religious
striving
after
freedom
they
cannot
q
free
themselves
from
that
sublime
thing
self
renunciation
the
liberals
anger
is
directed
against
egoism
for
the
egoist
you
know
never
takes
trouble
about
a
thing
for
the
sake
of
the
thing
but
for
his
sake
the
thing
must
serve
him
it
is
egoistic
to
ascribe
to
no
thing
a
value
of
its
own
an
absolute
value
but
to
seek
its
value
in
me
one
often
hears
that
pot
boiling
study
which
is
so
common
counted
among
the
most
repulsive
traits
of
egoistic
behaviour
because
it
manifests
the
most
shameful
desecration
of
science
but
what
is
science
for
but
to
be
consumed
if
one
does
not
know
how
to
use
it
for
anything
better
than
to
keep
the
pot
boiling
then
his
egoism
is
a
petty
one
indeed
because
this
egoists
power
is
a
limited
power
but
the
egoistic
element
in
it
and
the
desecration
of
science
only
a
possessed
man
can
blame
because
christianity
incapable
of
letting
the
individual
count
as
an
ego

thought
of
him
only
as
a
dependent
and
was
properly
nothing
but
a
social
theory
q
a
doctrine
of
living
together
and
that
of
man
with
god
as
well
as
of
man
with
man
q
therefore
in
it
everything
own
must
fall
into
most
woeful
disrepute
selfishness
self
will
ownness
self
love
and
the
like
the
christian
way
of
looking
at
things
has
on
all
sides
gradually
re
stamped
honourable
words
into
dishonourable
why
should
they
not
be
brought
into
honour
again
so
schimpf
contumely
is
in
its
old
sense
equivalent
to
jest
but
for
christian
seriousness
pastime
became
a
dishonour

for
that
seriousness
cannot
take
a
joke
frech
impudent
formerly
meant
only
bold
brave
frevel
wanton
outrage
was
only
daring
it
is
well
known
how
askance
the
word
reason
was
looked
at
for
a
long
time
our
language
has
settled
itself
pretty
well
to
the
christian
stand
point
and
the
general
consciousness
is
still
too
christian
not
to
shrink
in
terror
from
everything
un
christian
as
from
something
incomplete
or
evil
therefore
selfishness
is
in
a
bad
way
too
selfishness

in
the
christian
sense
means
something
like
this
i
look
only
to
see
whether
anything
is
of
use
to
me
as
a
sensual
man
but
is
sensuality
then
the

of

i
am
given
up
to
sensuality
do
i
follow
myself
my

determination
when
i
follow
that
i
am

in
the
session
of
february


welcker
argues
a
motion
on
the
dependence
of
the
judges
and
sets
forth
in
a
detailed
speech
that
removable
dismissable
transferable
and
pensionable
judges
q
in
short
such
members
of
a
court
of
justice
as
can
by
mere
administrative
process
be
damaged
and
endangered
are
wholly
without
reliability
yes
lose
all
respect
and
all
confidence
among
the
people
the
whole
bench
welcker
cries
is
demoralized
by
this
dependence
in
blunt
words
this
means
nothing
else
than
that
the
judges
find
it
more
to
their
advantage
to
give
judgment
as
the
ministers
would
have
them
than
to
give
it
as
the
law
would
have
them
how
is
that
to
be
helped
perhaps
by
bringing
home
to
the
judges
hearts
the
ignominiousness
of
their
venality
and
then
cherishing
the
confidence
that
they
will
repent
and
henceforth
prize
justice
more
highly
than
their
selfishness
no
the
people
does
not
soar
to
this
romantic
confidence
for
it
feels
that
selfishness
is
mightier
than
any
other
motive
therefore
the
same
persons
who
have
been
judges
hitherto
may
remain
so
however
thoroughly
one
has
convinced
himself
that
they
behaved
as
egoists
only
they
must
not
any
longer
find
their
selfishness
favoured
by
the
venality
of
justice
but
must
stand
so
independent
of
the
government
that
by
a
judgment
in
conformity
with
the
facts
they
do
not
throw
into
the
shade
their
own
cause
their
well
understood
interest
but
rather
secure
a
comfortable
combination
of
a
good
salary
with
respect
among
the
citizens
so
welcker
and
the

if
i

about

i

for

of

not

he

through

whom
does
the
liberal
look
upon
as
his
equal
man
be
only
man
q
and
that
you
are
anyway
q
and
the
liberal
calls
you
his
brother
he
asks
very
little
about
your
private
opinions
and
private
follies
if
only
he
can
espy
man
in
you
but
as
he
takes
little
heed
of
what
you
are
privatim
q
nay
in
a
strict
following
out
of
his
principle
sets
no
value
at
all
on
it
q
he
sees
in
you
only
what
you
are
generatim
in
other
words
he
sees
in
you
not
you
but
the
species
not
tom
or
jim
but
man
not
the
real
or
unique
one

but
your
essence
or
your
concept
not
the
bodily
man
but
the
spirit
as
tom
you
would
not
be
his
equal
because
he
is
jim
therefore
not
tom
as
man
you
are
the
same
that
he
is
and
since
as
tom
you
virtually
do
not
exist
at
all
for
him
so
far
to
wit
as
he
is
a
liberal
and
not
unconsciously
an
egoist
he
has
really
made
brother
love
very
easy
for
himself
he
loves
in
you
not
tom
of
whom
he
knows
nothing
and
wants
to
know
nothing
but
man
to
see
in
you
and
me
nothing
further
than
men
that
is
running
the
christian
way
of
looking
at
things
according
to
which
one
is
for
the
other
nothing
but
a
concept
a
man
called
to
salvation
for
instance
into
the
ground
christianity
properly
so
called
gathers
us
under
a
less
utterly
general
concept
there
we
are
sons
of
god
and
led
by
the
spirit
of
god

yet
not
all
can
boast
of
being
gods
sons
but
the
same
spirit
which
witnesses
to
our
spirit
that
we
are
sons
of
god
reveals
also
who
are
the
sons
of
the
devil

consequently
to
be
a
son
of
god
one
must
not
be
a
son
of
the
devil
the
sonship
of
god
excluded
certain
men
to
be
sons
of
men
q
that
is
men
q
on
the
contrary
we
need
nothing
but
to
belong
to
the
human
species
need
only
to
be
specimens
of
the
same
species
what
i
am
as
this
i
is
no
concern
of
yours
as
a
good
liberal
but
is
my
private
affair
alone
enough
that
we
are
both
sons
of
one
and
the
same
mother
to
wit
the
human
species
as
a
son
of
man
i
am
your
equal
what
am
i
now
to
you
perhaps
this
bodily
i
as
i
walk
and
stand
anything
but
that
this
bodily
i
with
its
thoughts
decisions
and
passions
is
in
your
eyes
a
private
affair
which
is
no
concern
of
yours
it
is
an
affair
by
itself
as
an
affair
for
you
there
exists
only
my
concept
my
generic
concept
only
the
man
who
as
he
is
called
tom
could
just
as
well
be
joe
or
dick
you
see
in
me
not
me
the
bodily
man
but
an
unreal
thing
the
spook
a
man
in
the
course
of
the
christian
centuries
we
declared
the
most
various
persons
to
be
our
equals
but
each
time
in
the
measure
of
that
spirit
which
we
expected
from
them
q
each
one
in
whom
the
spirit
of
the
need
of
redemption
may
be
assumed
then
later
each
one
who
has
the
spirit
of
integrity
finally
each
one
who
shows
a
human
spirit
and
a
human
face
thus
the
fundamental
principle
of
equality
varied
equality
being
now
conceived
as
equality
of
the
human
spirit
there
has
certainly
been
discovered
an
equality
that
includes
all
men
for
who
could
deny
that
we
men
have
a
human
spirit
that
is
no
other
than
a
human
but
are
we
on
that
account
further
on
now
than
in
the
beginning
of
christianity
then
we
were
to
have
a
divine
spirit
now
a
human
but
if
the
divine
did
not
exhaust
us
how
should
the
human
wholly
express
what
we
are
feuerbach
thinks
that
if
he
humanizes
the
divine
he
has
found
the
truth
no
if
god
has
given
us
pain
man
is
capable
of
pinching
us
still
more
torturingly
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
this
that
we
are
men
is
the
slightest
thing
about
us
and
has
significance
only
in
so
far
as
it
is
one
of
our
qualities

our
property

i
am
indeed
among
other
things
a
man
as
i
am
a
living
being
therefore
an
animal
or
a
european
a
berliner
and
the
like
but
he
who
chose
to
have
regard
for
me
only
as
a
man
or
as
a
berliner
would
pay
me
a
regard
that
would
be
very
unimportant
to
me
and
wherefore
because
he
would
have
regard
only
for
one
of
my
qualities
not
for
me
it
is
just
so
with
the
spirit
too
a
christian
spirit
an
upright
spirit
and
the
like
may
well
be
my
acquired
quality
my
property
but
i
am
not
this
spirit
it
is
mine
not
i
its
hence
we
have
in
liberalism
only
the
continuation
of
the
old
christian
depreciation
of
the
i
the
bodily
tom
instead
of
taking
me
as
i
am
one
looks
solely
at
my
property
my
qualities
and
enters
into
marriage
bonds
with
me
only
for
the
sake
of
my
q
possessions
one
marries
as
it
were
what
i
have
not
what
i
am
the
christian
takes
hold
of
my
spirit
the
liberal
of
my
humanity
but
if
the
spirit
which
is
not
regarded
as
the
property
of
the
bodily
ego
but
as
the
proper
ego
itself
is
a
ghost
then
the
man
too
who
is
not
recognized
as
my
quality
but
as
the
proper
i
is
nothing
but
a
spook
a
thought
a
concept
therefore
the
liberal
too
revolves
in
the
same
circle
as
the
christian
because
the
spirit
of
mankind
man
dwells
in
you
you
are
a
man
as
when
the
spirit
of
christ
dwells
in
you
you
are
a
christian
but
because
it
dwells
in
you
only
as
a
second
ego
even
though
it
be
as
your
proper
or
better
ego
it
remains
otherworldly
to
you
and
you
have
to
strive
to
become
wholly
man
a
striving
just
as
fruitless
as
the
christians
to
become
wholly
a
blessed
spirit
one
can
now
after
liberalism
has
proclaimed
man
declare
openly
that
herewith
was
only
completed
the
consistent
carrying
out
of
christianity
and
that
in
truth
christianity
set
itself
no
other
task
from
the
start
than
to
realize
man
the
true
man
hence
then
the
illusion
that
christianity
ascribes
an
infinite
value
to
the
ego
as
in
the
doctrine
of
immortality
in
the
cure
of
souls
etc
comes
to
light
no
it
assigns
this
value
to
man
alone
only
man
is
immortal
and
only
because
i
am
man
am
i
too
immortal
in
fact
christianity
had
to
teach
that
no
one
is
lost
just
as
liberalism
too
puts
all
on
an
equality
as
men
but
that
eternity
like
this
equality
applied
only
to
the
man
in
me
not
to
me
only
as
the
bearer
and
harbourer
of
man
do
i
not
die
as
notoriously
the
king
never
dies
louis
dies
but
the
king
remains
i
die
but
my
spirit
man
remains
to
identify
me
now
entirely
with
man
the
demand
has
been
invented
and
stated
that
i
must
become
a
real
generic
being

the
human
religion
is
only
the
last
metamorphosis
of
the
christian
religion
for
liberalism
is
a
religion
because
it
separates
my
essence
from
me
and
sets
it
above
me
because
it
exalts
man
to
the
same
extent
as
any
other
religion
does
its
god
or
idol
because
it
makes
what
is
mine
into
something
otherworldly
because
in
general
it
makes
out
of
what
is
mine
out
of
my
qualities
and
my
property
something
alien
q
to
wit
an
essence
in
short
because
it
sets
me
beneath
man
and
thereby
creates
for
me
a
vocation
but
liberalism
declares
itself
a
religion
in
form
too
when
it
demands
for
this
supreme
being
man
a
zeal
of
faith
a
faith
that
some
day
will
at
last
prove
its
fiery
zeal
too
a
zeal
that
will
be
invincible

but
as
liberalism
is
a
human
religion
its
professor
takes
a
tolerant
attitude
toward
the
professor
of
any
other
catholic
jewish
etc
as
frederick
the
great
did
toward
every
one
who
performed
his
duties
as
a
subject
whatever
fashion
of
becoming
blest
he
might
be
inclined
toward
this
religion
is
now
to
be
raised
to
the
rank
of
the
generally
customary
one
and
separated
from
the
others
as
mere
private
follies
toward
which
besides
one
takes
a
highly
liberal
attitude
on
account
of
their
unessentialness
one
may
call
it
the
state
religion
the
religion
of
the
free
state
not
in
the
sense
hitherto
current
that
it
is
the
one
favoured
or
privileged
by
the
state
but
as
that
religion
which
the
free
state
not
only
has
the
right
but
is
compelled
to
demand
from
each
of
those
who
belong
to
it
let
him
be
privatim
a
jew
a
christian
or
anything
else
for
it
does
the
same
service
to
the
state
as
filial
piety
to
the
family
if
the
family
is
to
be
recognized
and
maintained
in
its
existing
condition
by
each
one
of
those
who
belong
to
it
then
to
him
the
tie
of
blood
must
be
sacred
and
his
feeling
for
it
must
be
that
of
piety
of
respect
for
the
ties
of
blood
by
which
every
blood
relation
becomes
to
him
a
consecrated
person
so
also
to
every
member
of
the
state
community
this
community
must
be
sacred
and
the
concept
which
is
the
highest
to
the
state
must
likewise
be
the
highest
to
him
but
what
concept
is
the
highest
to
the
state
doubtless
that
of
being
a
really
human
society
a
society
in
which
every
one
who
is
really
a
man
that
is
not
an
un
man
can
obtain
admission
as
a
member
let
a
states
tolerance
go
ever
so
far
toward
an
un
man
and
toward
what
is
inhuman
it
ceases
and
yet
this
un
man
is
a
man
yet
the
inhuman
itself
is
something
human
yes
possible
only
to
a
man
not
to
any
beast
it
is
in
fact
something
possible
to
man
but
although
every
un
man
is
a
man
yet
the
state
excludes
him
it
locks
him
up
or
transforms
him
from
a
fellow
of
the
state
into
a
fellow
of
the
prison
fellow
of
the
lunatic
asylum
or
hospital
according
to
communism
to
say
in
blunt
words
what
an
un
man
is
is
not
particularly
hard
it
is
a
man
who
does
not
correspond
to
the
concept
man
as
the
inhuman
is
something
human
which
is
not
conformed
to
the
concept
of
the
human
logic
calls
this
a
self
contradictory
judgment
would
it
be
permissible
for
one
to
pronounce
this
judgment
that
one
can
be
a
man
without
being
a
man
if
he
did
not
admit
the
hypothesis
that
the
concept
of
man
can
be
separated
from
the
existence
the
essence
from
the
appearance
they
say
he
appears
indeed
as
a
man
but
is
not
a
man
men
have
passed
this
self
contradictory
judgment
through
a
long
line
of
centuries
nay
what
is
still
more
in
this
long
time
there
were
only
q
un
men
what
individual
can
have
corresponded
to
his
concept
christianity
knows
only
one
man
and
this
one
christ
q
is
at
once
an
un
man
again
in
the
reverse
sense
to
wit
a
superhuman
man
a
god
only
the
q
un
man
is
a
real
man
men
that
are
not
men
what
should
they
be
but
ghosts
every
real
man
because
he
does
not
correspond
to
the
concept
man
or
because
he
is
not
a
generic
man
is
a
spook
but
do
i
still
remain
an
un
man
even
if
i
bring
man
who
towered
above
me
and
remained
otherworldly
to
me
only
as
my
ideal
my
task
my
essence
or
concept
down
to
be
my
quality
my
own
and
inherent
in
me
so
that
man
is
nothing
else
than
my
humanity
my
human
existence
and
everything
that
i
do
is
human
precisely
because
i
do
it
but
not
because
it
corresponds
to
the
concept
man
i
am
really
man
and
the
un
man
in
one
for
i
am
a
man
and
at
the
same
time
more
than
a
man
i
am
the
ego
of
this
my
mere
quality
it
had
to
come
to
this
at
last
that
it
was
no
longer
merely
demanded
of
us
to
be
christians
but
to
become
men
for
though
we
could
never
really
become
even
christians
but
always
remained
poor
sinners
for
the
christian
was
an
unattainable
ideal
too
yet
in
this
the
contradictoriness
did
not
come
before
our
consciousness
so
and
the
illusion
was
easier
than
now
when
of
us
who
are
men
act
humanly
yes
cannot
do
otherwise
than
be
such
and
act
so
the
demand
is
made
that
we
are
to
be
men
real
men
our
states
of
today
because
they
still
have
all
sorts
of
things
sticking
to
them
left
from
their
churchly
mother
do
indeed
load
those
who
belong
to
them
with
various
obligations
such
as
churchly
religiousness
which
properly
do
not
a
bit
concern
them
the
states
yet
on
the
whole
they
do
not
deny
their
significance
since
they
want
to
be
looked
upon
as
human
societies
in
which
man
as
man
can
be
a
member
even
if
he
is
less
privileged
than
other
members
most
of
them
admit
adherence
of
every
religious
sect
and
receive
people
without
distinction
of
race
or
nation
jews
turks
moors
etc
can
become
french
citizens
in
the
act
of
reception
therefore
the
state
looks
only
to
see
whether
one
is
a
man
the
church
as
a
society
of
believers
could
not
receive
every
man
into
her
bosom
the
state
as
a
society
of
men
can
but
when
the
state
has
carried
its
principle
clear
through
of
presupposing
in
its
constituents
nothing
but
that
they
are
men
even
the
north
americans
still
presuppose
in
theirs
that
they
have
religion
at
least
the
religion
of
integrity
of
responsibility
then
it
has
dug
its
grave
while
it
will
fancy
that
those
whom
it
possesses
are
without
exception
men
these
have
meanwhile
become
without
exception
egoists
each
of
whom
utilizes
it
according
to
his
egoistic
powers
and
ends
against
the
egoists
human
society
is
wrecked
for
they
no
longer
have
to
do
with
each
other
as
men
but
appear
egoistically
as
an
i
against
a
you
altogether
different
from
me
and
in
opposition
to
me
if
the
state
must
count
on
our
humanity
it
is
the
same
if
one
says
it
must
count
on
our
morality
seeing
man
in
each
other
and
acting
as
men
toward
each
other
is
called
moral
behaviour
this
is
every
whit
the
spiritual
love
of
christianity
for
if
i
see
man
in
you
as
in
myself
i
see
man
and
nothing
but
man
then
i
care
for
you
as
i
would
care
for
myself
for
we
represent
you
see
nothing
but
the
mathematical
proposition
a
c
and
b
c
consequently
a
b
q
i
nothing
but
man
and
you
nothing
but
man
consequently
i
and
you
the
same
morality
is
incompatible
with
egoism
because
the
former
does
not
allow
validity
to
me
but
only
to
the
man
in
me
but
if
the
state
is
a
society
of
men
not
a
union
of
egos
each
of
whom
has
only
himself
before
his
eyes
then
it
cannot
last
without
morality
and
must
insist
on
morality
therefore
we
two
the
state
and
i
are
enemies
i
the
egoist
have
not
at
heart
the
welfare
of
this
human
society
i
sacrifice
nothing
to
it
i
only
utilize
it
but
to
be
able
to
utilize
it
completely
i
transform
it
rather
into
my
property
and
my
creature
that
is
i
annihilate
it
and
form
in
its
place
the
union
of
egoists

so
the
state
betrays
its
enmity
to
me
by
demanding
that
i
be
a
man
which
presupposes
that
i
may
also
not
be
a
man
but
rank
for
it
as
an
un
man
it
imposes
being
a
man
upon
me
as
a
duty
further
it
desires
me
to
do
nothing
along
with
which
it
cannot
last
so
its
permanence
is
to
be
sacred
for
me
then
i
am
not
to
be
an
egoist
but
a
respectable
upright
thus
moral
man
enough
before
it
and
its
permanence
i
am
to
be
impotent
and
respectful
this
state
not
a
present
one
indeed
but
still
in
need
of
being
first
created
is
the
ideal
of
advancing
liberalism
there
is
to
come
into
existence
a
true
society
of
men
in
which
every
man
finds
room
liberalism
means
to
realize
man
create
a
world
for
him
and
this
should
be
the
human
world
or
the
general
communistic
society
of
men
it
was
said
the
church
could
regard
only
the
spirit
the
state
s
to
regard
the
whole
man

but
is
not
man
spirit
the
kernel
of
the
state
is
simply
man
this
unreality
and
it
itself
is
only
a
society
of
men
the
world
which
the
believer
believing
spirit
creates
is
called
church
the
world
which
the
man
human
or
humane
spirit
creates
is
called
state
but
that
is
not
my
world
i
never
execute
anything
human
in
the
abstract
but
always
my
own
things
my
human
act
is
diverse
from
every
other
human
act
and
only
by
this
diversity
is
it
a
real
act
belonging
to
me
the
human
in
it
is
an
abstraction
and
as
such
spirit
abstracted
essence
bruno
bauer
states
judenfrage
p

that
the
truth
of
criticism
is
the
final
truth
and
in
fact
the
truth
sought
for
by
christianity
itself
q
to
wit
man
he
says
the
history
of
the
christian
world
is
the
history
of
the
supreme
fight
for
truth
for
in
it
q
and
in
it
only
q
the
thing
at
issue
is
the
discovery
of
the
final
or
the
primal
truth
q
man
and
freedom
all
right
let
us
accept
this
gain
and
let
us
take
man
as
the
ultimately
found
result
of
christian
history
and
of
the
religious
or
ideal
efforts
of
man
in
general
now
who
is
man
i
am
man
the
end
and
outcome
of
christianity
is
as
i
the
beginning
and
raw
material
of
the
new
history
a
history
of
enjoyment
after
the
history
of
sacrifices
a
history
not
of
man
or
humanity
but
of
q
me
man
ranks
as
the
general
now
then
i
and
the
egoistic
are
the
really
general
since
every
one
is
an
egoist
and
of
paramount
importance
to
himself
the
jewish
is
not
the
purely
egoistic
beca
use
the
jew
still
devotes
himself
to
jehovah
the
christian
is
not
because
the
christian
lives
on
the
grace
of
god
and
subjects
himself
to
him
as
jew
and
as
christian
alike
a
man
satisfies
only
certain
of
his
wants
only
a
certain
need
not
himself
a
half
egoism
because
the
egoism
of
a
half
man
who
is
half
he
half
jew
or
half
his
own
proprietor
half
a
slave
therefore
too
jew
and
christian
always
half
way
exclude
each
other
as
men
they
recognize
each
other
as
slaves
they
exclude
each
other
because
they
are
servants
of
two
different
masters
if
they
could
be
complete
egoists
they
would
exclude
each
other
wholly
and
hold
together
so
much
the
more
firmly
their
ignominy
is
not
that
they
exclude
each
other
but
that
this
is
done
only
half
way
bruno
bauer
on
the
contrary
thinks
jews
and
christians
cannot
regard
and
treat
each
other
as
men
till
they
give
up
the
separate
essence
which
parts
them
and
obligates
them
to
eternal
separation
recognize
the
general
essence
of
man
and
regard
this
as
their
true
essence
according
to
his
representation
the
defect
of
the
jews
and
the
christians
alike
lies
in
their
wanting
to
be
and
have
something
particular
instead
of
only
being
men
and
endeavouring
after
what
is
human
q
to
wit
the
general
rights
of
man
he
thinks
their
fundamental
error
consists
in
the
belief
that
they
are
privileged
possess
prerogatives
in
general
in
the
belief
in
prerogative

in
opposition
to
this
he
holds
up
to
them
the
general
rights
of
man
the
rights
of
man
q
man
is
man
in
general
and
in
so
far
every
one
who
is
a
man
now
every
one
is
to
have
the
eternal
rights
of
man
and
according
to
the
opinion
of
communism
enjoy
them
in
the
complete
democracy
or
as
it
ought
more
correctly
to
be
called
q
anthropocracy
but
it
is
i
alone
who
have
everything
that
i
q
procure
for
myself
as
man
i
have
nothing
people
would
like
to
give
every
man
an
affluence
of
all
good
merely
because
he
has
the
title
man
but
i
put
the
accent
on
me
not
on
my
being
man
man
is
something
only
as
my
quality
property

like
masculinity
or
femininity
the
ancients
found
the
ideal
in
ones
being
male
in
the
full
sense
their
virtue
is
virtus
and
arete
q
manliness
what
is
one
to
think
of
a
woman
who
should
want
only
to
be
perfectly
woman
that
is
not
given
to
all
and
many
a
one
would
therein
be
fixing
for
herself
an
unattainable
goal
feminine
on
the
other
hand
she
is
anyhow
by
nature
femininity
is
her
quality
and
she
does
not
need
true
femininity
i
am
a
man
just
as
the
earth
is
a
star
as
ridiculous
as
it
would
be
to
set
the
earth
the
task
of
being
a
thorough
star
so
ridiculous
it
is
to
burden
me
with
the
call
to
be
a
thorough
man
when
fichte
says
the
ego
is
all
this
seems
to
harmonize
perfectly
with
my
thesis
but
it
is
not
that
the
ego
is
all
but
the
ego
destroys
all
and
only
the
self
dissolving
ego
the
never
being
ego
the
q
finite
ego
is
really
i
fichte
speaks
of
the
absolute
ego
but
i
speak
of
me
the
transitory
ego
how
natural
is
the
supposition
that
man
and
ego
mean
the
same
and
yet
one
sees
as
by
feuerbach
that
the
expression
man
is
to
designate
the
absolute
ego
the
species
not
the
transitory
individual
ego
egoism
and
humanity
humaneness
ought
to
mean
the
same
but
according
to
feuerbach
the
individual
can
only
lift
himself
above
the
limits
of
his
individuality
but
not
above
the
laws
the
positive
ordinances
of
his
species

but
the
species
is
nothing
and
if
the
individual
lifts
himself
above
the
limits
of
his
individuality
this
is
rather
his
very
self
as
an
individual
he
exists
only
in
raising
himself
he
exists
only
in
not
remaining
what
he
is
otherwise
he
would
be
done
dead
man
with
the
great
m
is
only
an
ideal
the
species
only
something
thought
of
to
be
a
man
is
not
to
realize
the
ideal
of
man
but
to
present
oneself
the
individual
it
is
not
how
i
realize
the
generally
human
that
needs
to
be
my
task
but
how
i
satisfy
myself
i
am
my
species
am
without
norm
without
law
without
model
and
the
like
it
is
possible
that
i
can
make
very
little
out
of
myself
but
this
little
is
everything
and
is
better
than
what
i
allow
to
be
made
out
of
me
by
the
might
of
others
by
the
training
of
custom
religion
the
laws
the
state
better
q
if
the
talk
is
to
be
of
better
at
all
q
better
an
unmannerly
child
than
an
old
head
on
young
shoulders
better
a
mulish
man
than
a
man
compliant
in
everything
the
unmannerly
and
mulish
fellow
is
still
on
the
way
to
form
himself
according
to
his
own
will
the
prematurely
knowing
and
compliant
one
is
determined
by
the
species
the
general
demands
q
the
species
is
law
to
him
he
is
determined
by
it
for
what
else
is
the
species
to
him
but
his
destiny

his
calling
whether
i
look
to
humanity
the
species
in
order
to
strive
toward
this
ideal
or
to
god
and
christ
with
like
endeavour
where
is
the
essential
dissimilarity
at
most
the
former
is
more
washed
out
than
the
latter
as
the
individual
is
the
whole
of
nature
so
he
is
the
whole
of
the
species
too
everything
that
i
do
think
q
in
short
my
expression
or
manifestation
q
is
indeed
conditioned
by
what
i
am
the
jew
can
will
only
thus
or
thus
can
present
himself
only
thus
the
christian
can
present
and
manifest
himself
only
christianly
etc
if
it
were
possible
that
you
could
be
a
jew
or
christian
you
would
indeed
bring
out
only
what
was
jewish
or
christian
but
it
is
not
possible
in
the
most
rigourous
conduct
you
yet
remain
an
egoist
a
sinner
against
that
concept
q
you
are
not
the
precise
equivalent
of
jew
now
because
the
egoistic
always
keeps
peeping
through
people
have
inquired
for
a
more
perfect
concept
which
should
really
wholly
express
what
you
are
and
which
because
it
is
your
true
nature
should
contain
all
the
laws
of
your
activity
the
most
perfect
thing
of
the
kind
has
been
attained
in
man
as
a
jew
you
are
too
little
and
the
jewish
is
not
your
task
to
be
a
greek
a
german
does
not
suffice
but
be
a
q
man
then
you
have
everything
look
upon
the
human
as
your
calling
now
i
know
what
is
expected
of
me
and
the
new
catechism
can
be
written
the
subject
is
again
subjected
to
the
predicate
the
individual
to
something
general
the
dominion
is
again
secured
to
an
idea
and
the
foundation
laid
for
a
new
religion
this
is
a
step
forward
in
the
domain
of
religion
and
in
particular
of
christianity
not
a
step
out
beyond
it
to
step
out
beyond
it
leads
into
the
unspeakable
for
me
paltry
language
has
no
word
and
the
word
the
logos
is
to
me
a
mere
word
my
essence
is
sought
for
if
not
the
jew
the
german
then
at
any
rate
it
is
q
the
man
man
is
my
essence
i
am
repulsive
or
repugnant
to
myself
i
have
a
horror
and
loathing
of
myself
i
am
a
horror
to
myself
or
i
am
never
enough
for
myself
and
never
do
enough
to
satisfy
myself
from
such
feelings
springs
self
dissolution
or
self
criticism
religiousness
begins
with
self
renunciation
ends
with
completed
criticism
i
am
possessed
and
want
to
get
rid
of
the
evil
spirit
how
do
i
set
about
it
i
fearlessly
commit
the
sin
that
seems
to
the
christian
the
most
dire
the
sin
and
blasphemy
against
the
holy
spirit
he
who
blasphemes
the
holy
spirit
has
no
forgiveness
forever
but
is
liable
to
the
eternal
judgment

i
want
no
forgiveness
and
am
not
afraid
of
the
judgment
man
is
the
last
evil
spirit
or
spook
the
most
deceptive
or
most
intimate
the
craftiest
liar
with
honest
mien
the
father
of
lies
the
egoist
turning
against
the
demands
and
concepts
of
the
present
executes
pitilessly
the
most
measureless
q
desecration
nothing
is
holy
to
him
it
would
be
foolish
to
assert
that
there
is
no
power
above
mine
only
the
attitude
that
i
take
toward
it
will
be
quite
another
than
that
of
the
religious
age
i
shall
be
the
enemy
of
every
higher
power
while
religion
teaches
us
to
make
it
our
friend
and
be
humble
toward
it
the
desecrator
puts
forth
his
strength
against
every
fear
of
god
for
fear
of
god
would
determine
him
in
everything
that
he
left
standing
as
sacred
whether
it
is
the
god
or
the
man
that
exercises
the
hallowing
power
in
the
god
man
q
whether
therefore
anything
is
held
sacred
for
gods
sake
or
for
mans
humanitys
q
this
does
not
change
the
fear
of
god
since
man
is
revered
as
supreme
essence
as
much
as
on
the
specifically
religious
stand
point
god
as
supreme
essence
calls
for
our
fear
and
reverence
both
overawe
us
the
fear
of
god
in
the
proper
sense
was
shaken
long
ago
and
a
more
or
less
conscious
atheism
externally
recognizable
by
a
wide
spread
unchurchliness
has
involuntarily
become
the
mode
but
what
was
taken
from
god
has
been
superadded
to
man
and
the
power
of
humanity
grew
greater
in
just
the
degree
that
that
of
piety
lost
weight
man
is
the
god
of
today
and
fear
of
man
has
taken
the
place
of
the
old
fear
of
god
but
because
man
represents
only
another
supreme
being
nothing
in
fact
has
taken
place
but
a
metamorphosis
in
the
supreme
being
and
the
fear
of
man
is
merely
an
altered
form
of
the
fear
of
god
our
atheists
are
pious
people
if
in
the
so
called
feudal
times
we
held
everything
as
a
fief
from
god
in
the
liberal
period
the
same
feudal
relation
exists
with
man
god
was
the
lord
now
man
is
the
lord
god
was
the
mediator
now
man
is
god
was
the
spirit
now
man
is
in
this
three
fold
regard
the
feudal
relation
has
experienced
a
transformation
for
now
firstly
we
hold
as
a
fief
from
all
powerful
man
our
power
which
because
it
comes
from
a
higher
is
not
called
power
or
might
but
right
q
the
rights
of
man
we
further
hold
as
a
fief
from
him
our
position
in
the
world
for
he
the
mediator
mediates
our
intercourse
with
others
which
therefore
may
not
be
otherwise
than
human
finally
we
hold
as
a
fief
from
him
ourselves
q
to
wit
our
own
value
or
all
that
we
are
worth
q
inasmuch
as
we
are
worth
nothing
when
he
does
not
dwell
in
us
and
when
or
where
we
are
not
human
the
power
is
mans
the
world
is
mans
i
am
mans
but
am
i
not
still
unrestrained
from
declaring
myself
the
entitler
the
mediator
and
the
own
self
then
it
runs
thus
my
power
is
my
property
my
power
gives
me
property
my
power
am
i
myself
and
through
it
am
i
my
property
a
my
power
right
is
the
spirit
of
society
if
society
has
a
will
this
will
is
simply
right
society
exists
only
through
right
but
as
it
endures
only
exercising
a
sovereignty
over
individuals
right
is
its
sovereign
will
aristotle
says
justice
is
the
advantage
of
society
all
existing
right
is
q
foreign
law
some
one
makes
me
out
to
be
in
the
right
does
right
by
me
but
should
i
therefore
be
in
the
right
if
all
the
world
made
me
out
so
and
yet
what
else
is
the
right
that
i
obtain
in
the
state
in
society
but
a
right
of
those
foreign
to
me
when
a
blockhead
makes
me
out
in
the
right
i
grow
distrustful
of
my
rightness
i
dont
like
to
receive
it
from
him
but
even
when
a
wise
man
makes
me
out
in
the
right
i
nevertheless
am
not
in
the
right
on
that
account
whether
i
am
in
the
right
is
completely
independent
of
the
fools
making
out
and
of
the
wise
mans
all
the
same
we
have
coveted
this
right
till
now
we
seek
for
right
and
turn
to
the
court
for
that
purpose
to
what
to
a
royal
a
papal
a
popular
court
etc
can
a
sultanic
court
declare
another
right
than
that
which
the
sultan
has
ordained
to
be
right
can
it
make
me
out
in
the
right
if
i
seek
for
a
right
that
does
not
agree
with
the
sultans
law
can
it
for
instance
concede
to
me
high
treason
as
a
right
since
it
is
assuredly
not
a
right
according
to
the
sultans
mind
can
it
as
a
court
of
censorship
allow
me
the
free
utterance
of
opinion
as
a
right
since
the
sultan
will
hear
nothing
of
this
my
right
what
am
i
seeking
for
in
this
court
then
i
am
seeking
for
sultanic
right
not
my
right
i
am
seeking
for
q
foreign
right
as
long
as
this
foreign
right
harmonizes
with
mine
to
be
sure
i
shall
find
in
it
the
latter
too
the
state
does
not
permit
pitching
into
each
other
man
to
man
it
opposes
the
duel
even
every
ordinary
appeal
to
blows
notwithstanding
that
neither
of
the
fighters
calls
the
police
to
it
is
punished
except
when
it
is
not
an
i
whacking
away
at
a
you
but
say
the
head
of
a
family
at
the
child
th
e
family
is
entitled
to
this
and
in
its
name
the
father
i
as
ego
am
not
the
vossische
zeitungpresents
to
us
the
commonwealth
of
right
there
everything
is
to
be
decided
by
the
judge
and
a
court
it
ranks
the
supreme
court
of
censorship
as
a
court
where
right
is
declared
what
sort
of
a
right
the
right
of
the
censorship
to
recognize
the
sentences
of
that
court
as
right
one
must
regard
the
censorship
as
right
but
it
is
thought
nevertheless
that
this
court
offers
a
protection
yes
protection
against
an
individual
censors
error
it
protects
only
the
censorship
legislator
against
false
interpretation
of
his
will
at
the
same
time
making
his
statute
by
the
sacred
power
of
right
all
the
firmer
against
writers
whether
i
am
in
the
right
or
not
there
is
no
judge
but
myself
others
can
judge
only
whether
they
endorse
my
right
and
whether
it
exists
as
right
for
them
too
in
the
meantime
let
us
take
the
matter
yet
another
way
i
am
to
reverence
sultanic
law
in
the
sultanate
popular
law
in
republics
canon
law
in
catholic
communities
to
these
laws
i
am
to
subordinate
myself
i
am
to
regard
them
as
sacred
a
sense
of
right
and
law
abiding
mind
of
such
a
sort
is
so
firmly
planted
in
peoples
heads
that
the
most
revolutionary
persons
of
our
days
want
to
subject
us
to
a
new
sacred
law
the
law
of
society
the
law
of
mankind
the
right
of
all
and
the
like
the
right
of
all
is
to
go
before
my
right
as
a
right
of
all
it
would
indeed
be
my
right
among
the
rest
since
i
with
the
rest
am
included
in
all
but
that
it
is
at
the
same
time
a
right
of
others
or
even
of
all
others
does
not
move
me
to
its
upholding
not
as
a
right
of
all
will
i
defend
it
but
as
my
right
and
then
every
other
may
see
to
it
how
he
shall
likewise
maintain
it
for
himself
the
right
of
all
for
example
to
eat
is
a
right
of
every
individual
let
each
keep
this
right
unabridged
for
himself
then
all
exercise
it
spontaneously
let
him
not
take
care
for
all
though
q
let
him
not
grow
zealous
for
it
as
for
a
right
of
all
but
the
social
reformers
preach
to
us
a
law
of
society
there
the
individual
becomes
societys
slave
and
is
in
the
right
only
when
society
makes
him
out
in
the
right
when
he
lives
according
to
societys
statutes
and
so
is
q
loyal
whether
i
am
loyal
under
a
despotism
or
in
a
society
a
la
weitling

it
is
the
same
absence
of
right
in
so
far
as
in
both
cases
i
have
not
my
right
but
foreign
right
in
consideration
of
right
the
question
is
always
asked
what
or
who
gives
me
the
right
to
it
answer
god
love
reason
nature
humanity
etc
no
only
your
might
your
power
gives
you
the
right
your
reason
therefore
may
give
it
to
you
communism
which
assumes
that
men
have
equal
rights
by
nature
contradicts
its
own
proposition
till
it
comes
to
this
that
men
have
no
right
at
all
by
nature
for
it
is
not
willing
to
recognize
for
instance
that
parents
have
by
nature
rights
as
against
their
children
or
the
children
as
against
the
parents
it
abolishes
the
family
nature
gives
parents
brothers
and
so
on
no
right
at
all
altogether
this
entire
revolutionary
or
babouvist
principle
rests
on
a
religious
that
is
false
view
of
things
who
can
ask
after
right
if
he
does
not
occupy
the
religious
stand
point
himself
is
not
right
a
religious
concept
something
sacred
why
equality
of
rights
as
the
revolution
propounded
it
is
only
another
name
for
christian
equality
the
equality
of
the
brethren
of
gods
children
of
christians
in
short
fraternit
each
and
every
inquiry
after
right
deserves
to
be
lashed
with
schillers
words
many
a
year
ive
used
my
nose
to
smell
the
onion
and
the
rose
is
there
any
proof
which
shows
that
ive
a
right
to
that
same
nose
when
the
revolution
stamped
equality
as
a
right
it
took
flight
into
the
religious
domain
into
the
region
of
the
sacred
of
the
ideal
hence
since
then
the
fight
for
the
sacred
inalienable
rights
of
man
against
the
eternal
rights
of
man
the
well
earned
rights
of
the
established
order
are
quite
naturally
and
with
equal
right
brought
to
bear
right
against
right
where
of
course
one
is
decried
by
the
other
as
wrong
this
has
been
the
contest
of
rights

since
the
revolution
you
want
to
be
in
the
right
as
against
the
rest
that
you
cannot
as
against
them
you
remain
forever
in
the
wrong
for
they
surely
would
not
be
your
opponents
if
they
were
not
in
their
right
too
they
will
always
make
you
out
in
the
wrong
but
as
against
the
right
of
the
rest
yours
is
a
higher
greater
more
powerful
right
is
it
not
no
such
thing
your
right
is
not
more
powerful
if
you
are
not
more
powerful
have
chinese
subjects
a
right
to
freedom
just
bestow
it
on
them
and
then
look
how
far
you
have
gone
wrong
in
your
attempt
because
they
do
not
know
how
to
use
freedom
they
have
no
right
to
it
or
in
clearer
terms
because
they
have
not
freedom
they
have
not
the
right
to
it
children
have
no
right
to
the
condition
of
majority
because
they
are
not
of
age
because
they
are
children
peoples
that
let
themselves
be
kept
in
nonage
have
no
rights
to
the
condition
of
majority
if
they
ceased
to
be
in
nonage
then
only
would
they
have
the
right
to
be
of
age
this
means
nothing
else
than
what
you
have
the
power
to
be
you
have
the
right
to
i
derive
all
right
and
all
warrant
from
me
i
am
entitled
to
everything
that
i
have
in
my
power
i
am
entitled
to
overthrow
zeus
jehovah
god
if
i
can
if
i
cannot
then
these
gods
will
always
remain
in
the
right
and
in
power
as
against
me
and
what
i
do
will
be
to
fear
their
right
and
their
power
in
impotent
god
fearingness
to
keep
their
commandments
and
believe
that
i
do
right
in
everything
that
i
do
according
to
their
right
about
as
the
russian
boundary
sentinels
think
themselves
rightfully
entitled
to
shoot
dead
the
suspicious
persons
who
are
escaping
since
they
murder
by
superior
authority
with
right

but
i
am
entitled
by
myself
to
murder
if
i
myself
do
not
forbid
it
to
myself
if
i
myself
do
not
fear
murder
as
a
wrong
this
view
of
things
lies
at
the
foundation
of
chamissos
poem
the
valley
of
murder
where
the
gray
haired
indian
murderer
compels
reverence
from
the
white
man
whose
brethren
he
has
murdered
the
only
thing
i
am
not
entitled
to
is
what
i
do
not
do
with
a
free
cheer
that
is
what
i
do
not
entitle
myself
to
i
decide
whether
it
is
the
right
thing
in
me
there
is
no
right
outside
me
if
it
is
right
for
me

it
is
right
possibly
this
may
not
suffice
to
make
it
right
for
the
rest
that
is
their
care
not
mine
let
them
defend
themselves
and
if
for
the
whole
world
something
were
not
right
but
it
were
right
for
me
that
is
i
wanted
it
then
i
would
ask
nothing
about
the
whole
world
so
every
one
does
who
knows
how
to
value
himself
every
one
in
the
degree
that
he
is
an
egoist
for
might
goes
before
right
and
that
q
with
perfect
right
because
i
am
by
nature
a
man
i
have
an
equal
right
to
the
enjoyment
of
all
goods
says
babeuf
must
he
not
also
say
because
i
am
by
nature
a
first
born
prince
i
have
a
right
to
the
throne
the
rights
of
man
and
the
well
earned
rights
come
to
the
same
thing
in
the
end
to
wit
to
nature
which
gives
me
a
right
that
is
to
birth
and
further
inheritance
i
am
born
as
a
man
is
equal
to
i
am
born
as
a
kings
son
the
natural
man
has
only
a
natural
right
because
he
has
only
a
natural
power
and
natural
claims
he
has
right
of
birth
and
claims
of
birth
but
nature
cannot
entitle
me
give
me
capacity
or
might
to
that
to
which
only
my
act
entitles
me
that
the
kings
child
sets
himself
above
other
children
even
this
is
his
act
which
secures
to
him
the
precedence
and
that
the
other
children
approve
and
recognize
this
act
is
their
act
which
makes
them
worthy
to
be
subjects
whether
nature
gives
me
a
right
or
whether
god
the
peoples
choice
etc
does
so
all
of
that
is
the
same
foreign
right
a
right
that
i
do
not
give
or
take
to
myself
thus
the
communists
say
equal
labour
entitles
man
to
equal
enjoyment
formerly
the
question
was
raised
whether
the
virtuous
man
must
not
be
happy
on
earth
the
jews
actually
drew
this
inference
that
it
may
go
well
with
thee
on
earth
no
equal
labour
does
not
entitle
you
to
it
but
equal
enjoyment
alone
entitles
you
to
equal
enjoyment
enjoy
then
you
are
entitled
to
enjoyment
but
if
you
have
laboured
and
let
the
enjoyment
be
taken
from
you
then
q
it
serves
you
right
if
you
take
the
enjoyment
it
is
your
right
if
on
the
contrary
you
only
pine
for
it
without
laying
hands
on
it
it
remains
as
before
a
well
earned
right
of
those
who
are
privileged
for
enjoyment
it
is
their
right
as
by
laying
hands
on
it
would
become
your
right
the
conflict
over
the
right
of
property
wavers
in
vehement
commotion
the
communists
affirm
that
the
earth
belongs
rightfully
to
him
who
tills
it
and
its
products
to
those
who
bring
them
out
i
think
it
belongs
to
him
who
knows
how
to
take
it
or
who
does
not
let
it
be
taken
from
him
does
not
let
himself
be
deprived
of
it
if
he
appropriates
it
then
not
only
the
earth
but
the
right
to
it
too
belongs
to
him
this
is
egoistic
right
it
is
right
for
me
therefore
it
is
right
aside
from
this
right
does
have
a
wax
nose
the
tiger
that
assails
me
is
in
the
right
and
i
who
strike
him
down
am
also
in
the
right
i
defend
against
him
not
my
right
but
myself
as
human
right
is
always
something
given
it
always
in
reality
reduces
to
the
right
which
men
give
concede
to
each
other
if
the
right
to
existence
is
conceded
to
new
born
children
then
they
have
the
right
if
it
is
not
conceded
to
them
as
was
the
case
among
the
spartans
and
ancient
romans
then
they
do
not
have
it
for
only
society
can
give
or
concede
it
to
them
they
themselves
cannot
take
it
or
give
it
to
themselves
it
will
be
objected
the
children
had
nevertheless
by
nature
the
right
to
exist
only
the
spartans
refused
recognition
to
this
right
but
then
they
simply
had
no
right
to
this
recognition
q
no
more
than
they
had
to
recognition
of
their
life
by
the
wild
beasts
to
which
they
were
thrown
people
talk
so
much
about
birthright
and
complain
there
is
alas
q
no
mention
of
the
rights
that
were
born
with
us

what
sort
of
right
then
is
there
that
was
born
with
me
the
right
to
receive
an
entailed
estate
to
inherit
a
throne
to
enjoy
a
princely
or
noble
education
or
again
because
poor
parents
begot
me
to
q
get
free
schooling
be
clothed
out
of
contributions
of
alms
and
at
last
earn
my
bread
and
my
herring
in
the
coal
mines
or
at
the
loom
are
these
not
birthrights
rights
that
have
come
down
to
me
from
my
parents
through
birth
you
think
q
no
you
think
these
are
only
rights
improperly
so
called
it
is
just
these
rights
that
you
aim
to
abolish
through
the
real
birthright
to
give
a
basis
for
this
you
go
back
to
the
simplest
thing
and
affirm
that
every
one
is
by
birth
equal
to
another
q
to
wit
a
man
i
will
grant
you
that
every
one
is
born
as
man
hence
the
new
born
are
therein
equal
to
each
other
why
are
they
only
because
they
do
not
yet
show
and
exert
themselves
as
anything
but
bare
q
children
of
men
naked
little
human
beings
but
thereby
they
are
at
once
different
from
those
who
have
already
made
something
out
of
themselves
who
thus
are
no
longer
bare
children
of
man
but
q
children
of
their
own
creation
the
latter
possesses
more
than
bare
birthrights
they
have
earned
rights
what
an
antithesis
what
a
field
of
combat
the
old
combat
of
the
birthrights
of
man
and
well
earned
rights
go
right
on
appealing
to
your
birthrights
people
will
not
fail
to
oppose
to
you
the
well
earned
both
stand
on
the
ground
of
right
for
each
of
the
two
has
a
right
against
the
other
the
one
the
birthright
of
natural
right
the
other
the
earned
or
well
earned
right
if
you
remain
on
the
ground
of
right
you
remain
in
rechthaberei

the
other
cannot
give
you
your
right
he
cannot
mete
out
right
to
you
he
who
has
might
has
q
right
if
you
have
not
the
former
neither
have
you
the
latter
is
this
wisdom
so
hard
to
attain
just
look
at
the
mighty
and
their
doings
we
are
talking
here
only
of
china
and
japan
of
course
just
try
it
once
you
chinese
and
japanese
to
make
them
out
in
the
wrong
and
learn
by
experience
how
they
throw
you
into
jail
only
do
not
confuse
with
this
the
well
meaning
counsels
which
q
in
china
and
japan
q
are
permitted
because
they
do
not
hinder
the
mighty
one
but
possibly
help
him
on
for
him
who
should
want
to
make
them
out
in
the
wrong
there
would
stand
open
only
one
way
thereto
that
of
might
if
he
deprives
them
of
their
might
then
he
has
really
made
them
out
in
the
wrong
deprived
them
of
their
right
in
any
other
case
he
can
do
nothing
but
clench
his
little
fist
in
his
pocket
or
fall
a
victim
as
an
obtrusive
fool
in
short
if
you
chinese
or
japanese
did
not
ask
after
right
and
in
particular
if
you
did
not
ask
after
the
rights
that
were
born
with
you
then
you
would
not
need
to
ask
at
all
after
the
well
earned
rights
either
you
start
back
in
fright
before
others
because
you
think
you
see
beside
them
the
ghost
of
right
which
as
in
the
homeric
combats
seems
to
fight
as
a
goddess
at
their
side
helping
them
what
do
you
do
do
you
throw
the
spear
no
you
creep
around
to
gain
the
spook
over
to
yourselves
that
it
may
fight
on
your
side
you
woo
for
the
ghosts
favour
another
would
simply
ask
thus
do
i
will
what
my
opponent
wills
no
now
then
there
may
fight
for
him
a
thousand
devils
or
gods
i
go
at
him
all
the
same
the
commonwealth
of
right
as
the
vossische
zeitung
among
others
stands
for
it
asks
that
office
holders
be
removable
only
by
the
judge
not
by
the
administration
vain
illusion
if
it
were
settled
by
law
that
an
office
holder
who
is
once
seen
drunken
shall
lose
his
office
then
the
judges
would
have
to
condemn
him
on
the
word
of
the
witnesses
in
short
the
law
giver
would
only
have
to
state
precisely
all
the
possible
grounds
which
entail
the
loss
of
office
however
laughable
they
might
be
that
is
he
who
laughs
in
his
superiors
faces
who
does
not
go
to
church
every
sunday
who
does
not
take
the
communion
every
four
weeks
who
runs
in
debt
who
has
disreputable
associates
who
shows
no
determination
etc
shall
be
removed
these
things
the
law
giver
might
take
it
into
his
head
to
prescribe
for
a
court
of
honour
then
the
judge
would
solely
have
to
investigate
whether
the
accused
had
become
guilty
of
those
offences
and
on
presentation
of
the
proof
pronounce
sentence
of
removal
against
him
in
the
name
of
the
law
the
judge
is
lost
when
he
ceases
to
be
mechanical
when
he
is
forsaken
by
the
rules
of
evidence
then
he
no
longer
has
anything
but
an
opinion
like
everybody
else
and
if
he
decides
according
to
this
opinion
his
action
is
no
longer
an
official
action
as
judge
he
must
decide
only
according
to
the
law
commend
me
rather
to
the
old
french
parliaments
which
wanted
to
examine
for
themselves
what
was
to
be
matters
of
right
and
to
register
it
only
after
their
own
approval
they
at
least
judged
according
to
a
right
of
their
own
and
were
not
willing
to
give
themselves
up
to
be
machines
of
the
law
giver
although
as
judges
they
must
to
be
sure
become
their
own
machines
it
is
said
that
punishment
is
the
criminals
right
but
impunity
is
just
as
much
his
right
if
his
undertaking
succeeds
it
serves
him
right
and
if
it
does
not
succeed
it
likewise
serves
him
right
you
make
your
bed
and
lie
in
it
if
some
one
goes
foolhardily
into
dangers
and
perishes
in
them
we
are
apt
to
say
it
serves
him
right
he
would
have
it
so
but
if
he
conquered
the
dangers
if
his
might
was
victorious
then
he
would
be
in
the
right
too
if
a
child
plays
with
the
knife
and
gets
cut
it
is
served
right
but
if
it
doesnt
get
cut
it
is
served
right
too
hence
right
befalls
the
criminal
doubtless
when
he
suffers
what
he
risked
why
what
did
he
risk
it
for
since
he
knew
the
possible
consequences
but
the
punishment
that
we
decree
against
him
is
only
our
right
not
his
our
right
reacts
against
his
and
he
is
q
in
the
wrong
at
last
because
q
we
get
the
upper
hand

but
what
is
right
what
is
matter
of
right
in
a
society
is
voiced
too
q
in
the
law

whatever
the
law
may
be
it
must
be
respected
by
the
q
loyal
citizen
thus
the
law
abiding
mind
of
old
england
is
eulogized
to
this
that
euripidean
sentiment
orestes

entirely
corresponds
we
serve
the
gods
whatever
the
gods
are
law
as
such
god
as
such
thus
far
we
are
today
people
are
at
pains
to
distinguish
law
from
arbitrary
orders
from
an
ordinance
the
former
comes
from
a
duly
entitled
authority
but
a
law
over
human
action
ethical
law
state
law
etc
is
always
a
declaration
of
will
and
so
an
order
yes
even
if
i
myself
gave
myself
the
law
it
would
yet
be
only
my
order
to
which
in
the
next
moment
i
can
refuse
obedience
one
may
well
enough
declare
what
he
will
put
up
with
and
so
deprecate
the
opposite
of
the
law
making
known
that
in
the
contrary
case
he
will
treat
the
transgressor
as
his
enemy
but
no
one
has
any
business
to
command
my
actions
to
say
what
course
i
shall
pursue
and
set
up
a
code
to
govern
it
i
must
put
up
with
it
that
he
treats
me
as
his
enemy
but
never
that
he
makes
free
with
me
as
his
creature
and
that
he
makes
his
reason
or
even
unreason
my
plumb
line
states
last
only
so
long
as
there
is
a
ruling
will
and
this
ruling
will
is
looked
upon
as
tantamount
to
the
own
will
the
lords
will
is
q
law
what
do
your
laws
amount
to
if
no
one
obeys
them
what
your
orders
if
nobody
lets
himself
be
ordered
the
state
cannot
forbear
the
claim
to
determine
the
individuals
will
to
speculate
and
count
on
this
for
the
state
it
is
indispensable
that
nobody
have
an
own
will
if
one
had
the
state
would
have
to
exclude
lock
up
banish
etc
this
one
if
all
had
they
would
do
away
with
the
state
the
state
is
not
thinkable
without
lordship
and
servitude
subjection
for
the
state
must
will
to
be
the
lord
of
all
that
it
embraces
and
this
will
is
called
the
will
of
the
state
he
who
to
hold
his
own
must
count
on
the
absence
of
will
in
others
is
a
thing
made
by
these
others
as
the
master
is
a
thing
made
by
the
servant
if
submissiveness
ceased
it
would
be
over
with
all
lordship
the
own
will
of
me
is
the
states
destroyer
it
is
therefore
branded
by
the
state
as
self
will
own
will
and
the
state
are
powers
in
deadly
hostility
between
which
no
eternal
peace
is
possible
as
long
as
the
state
asserts
itself
it
represents
own
will
its
ever
hostile
opponent
as
unreasonable
evil
and
the
latter
lets
itself
be
talked
into
believing
this
q
nay
it
really
is
such
for
no
more
reason
than
this
that
it
still
lets
itself
be
talked
into
such
belief
it
has
not
yet
come
to
itself
and
to
the
consciousness
of
its
dignity
hence
it
is
still
incomplete
still
amenable
to
fine
words
every
state
is
a
despotism
be
the
despot
one
or
many
or
as
one
is
likely
to
imagine
about
a
republic
if
all
be
lords
that
is
despotize
one
over
another
for
this
is
the
case
when
the
law
given
at
any
time
the
expressed
volition
of
it
may
be
a
popular
assembly
is
thenceforth
to
be
law
for
the
individual
to
which
obedience
is
due
from
him
or
toward
which
he
has
the
duty
of
obedience
if
one
were
even
to
conceive
the
case
that
every
individual
in
the
people
had
expressed
the
same
will
and
hereby
a
complete
collective
will
had
come
into
being
the
matter
would
still
remain
the
same
would
i
not
be
bound
today
and
henceforth
to
my
will
of
yesterday
my
will
would
in
this
case
be
frozen
wretched
stability
my
creature
q
to
wit
a
particular
expression
of
will
q
would
have
become
my
commander
but
i
in
my
will
i
the
creator
should
be
hindered
in
my
flow
and
my
dissolution
because
i
was
a
fool
yesterday
i
must
remain
such
my
life
long
so
in
the
state
life
i
am
at
best
q
i
might
just
as
well
say
at
worst
q
a
bondman
of
myself
because
i
was
a
willer
yesterday
i
am
today
without
will
yesterday
voluntary
today
involuntary
how
change
it
only
be
recognizing
no
duty
not
binding
myself
nor
letting
myself
be
bound
if
i
have
no
duty
then
i
know
no
law
either
but
they
will
bind
me
my
will
nobody
can
bind
and
my
disinclination
remains
free
why
everything
must
go
topsy
turvy
if
every
one
could
do
what
he
would
well
who
says
that
every
one
can
do
everything
what
are
you
there
for
pray
you
who
do
not
need
to
put
up
with
everything
defend
yourself
and
no
one
will
do
anything
to
you
he
who
would
break
your
will
has
to
do
with
you
and
is
your
enemy
deal
with
him
as
such
if
there
stand
behind
you
for
your
protection
some
millions
more
then
you
are
an
imposing
power
and
will
have
an
easy
victory
but
even
if
as
a
power
you
overawe
your
opponent
still
you
are
not
on
that
account
a
hallowed
authority
to
him
unless
he
be
a
simpleton
he
does
not
owe
you
respect
and
regard
even
though
he
will
have
to
consider
your
might
we
are
accustomed
to
classify
states
according
to
the
different
ways
in
which
the
supreme
might
is
distributed
if
an
individual
has
it
q
monarchy
if
all
have
it
q
democracy
etc
supreme
might
then
might
against
whom
against
the
individual
and
his
self
will
the
state
practices
violence
the
individual
must
not
do
so
the
states
behaviour
is
violence
and
it
calls
its
violence
law
that
of
the
individual
crime
crime

then
q
so
the
individuals
violence
is
called
and
only
by
crime
does
he
overcome
the
states
violence
when
he
thinks
that
the
state
is
not
above
him
but
he
is
above
the
state
now
if
i
wanted
to
act
ridiculously
i
might
as
a
well
meaning
person
admonish
you
not
to
make
laws
which
impair
my
self
development
self
activity
self
creation
i
do
not
give
this
advice
for
if
you
should
follow
it
you
would
be
unwise
and
i
should
have
been
cheated
of
my
entire
profit
i
request
nothing
at
all
from
you
for
whatever
i
might
demand
you
would
still
be
dictatorial
law
givers
and
must
be
so
because
a
raven
cannot
sing
nor
a
robber
live
without
robbery
rather
do
i
ask
those
who
would
be
egoists
what
they
think
the
more
egoistic
q
to
let
laws
be
given
them
by
you
and
to
respect
those
that
are
given
or
to
practice
refractoriness
yes
complete
disobedience
good
hearted
people
think
the
laws
ought
to
prescribe
only
what
is
accepted
in
the
peoples
feeling
as
right
and
proper
but
what
concern
is
it
of
mine
what
is
accepted
in
the
nation
and
by
the
nation
the
nation
will
perhaps
be
against
the
blasphemer
therefore
a
law
against
blasphemy
am
i
not
to
blaspheme
on
that
account
is
this
law
to
be
more
than
an
order
to
me
i
put
the
question
solely
from
the
principle
that
all
right
and
all
authority
belong
to
the
collectivity
of
the
people
do
all
forms
of
government
arise
for
none
of
them
lacks
this
appeal
to
the
collectivity
and
the
despot
as
well
as
the
president
or
any
aristocracy
acts
and
commands
in
the
name
of
the
state
they
are
in
possession
of
the
authority
of
the
state
and
it
is
perfectly
indifferent
whether
were
this
possible
the
people
as
a
collectivity
all
individuals
exercise
this
state
q
authority
or
whether
it
is
only
the
representatives
of
this
collectivity
be
there
many
of
them
as
in
aristocracies
or
one
as
in
monarchies
always
the
collectivity
is
above
the
individual
and
has
a
power
which
is
called
legitimate
which
is
law
over
against
the
sacredness
of
the
state
the
individual
is
only
a
vessel
of
dishonour
in
which
exuberance
malevolence
mania
for
ridicule
and
slander
frivolity
are
left
as
soon
as
he
does
not
deem
that
object
of
veneration
the
state
to
be
worthy
of
recognition
the
spiritual
haughtiness
of
the
servants
and
subjects
of
the
state
has
fine
penalties
against
unspiritual
exuberance
when
the
government
designates
as
punishable
all
play
of
mind
against
the
state
the
moderate
liberals
come
and
opine
that
fun
satire
wit
humour
must
have
free
play
anyhow
and
genius
must
enjoy
freedom
so
not
the
individual
man
indeed
but
still
genius
is
to
be
free
here
the
state
or
in
its
name
the
government
says
with
perfect
right
he
who
is
not
for
me
is
against
me
fun
wit
etc
q
in
short
the
turning
of
state
affairs
into
a
comedy
q
have
undermined
states
from
of
old
they
are
not
innocent
and
further
what
boundaries
are
to
be
drawn
between
guilty
and
innocent
wit
at
this
question
the
moderates
fall
into
great
perplexity
and
everything
reduces
itself
to
the
prayer
that
the
state
government
would
please
not
be
so
sensitive
so
ticklish
that
it
would
not
immediately
scent
malevolence
in
harmless
things
and
would
in
general
be
a
little
more
tolerant
exaggerated
sensitiveness
is
certainly
a
weakness
its
avoidance
may
be
praiseworthy
virtue
but
in
time
of
war
one
cannot
be
sparing
and
what
may
be
allowed
under
peaceable
circumstances
ceases
to
be
permitted
as
soon
as
a
state
of
siege
is
declared
because
the
well
meaning
liberals
feel
this
plainly
they
hasten
to
declare
that
considering
the
devotion
of
the
people
there
is
assuredly
no
danger
to
be
feared
but
the
government
will
be
wiser
and
not
let
itself
be
talked
into
believing
anything
of
that
sort
it
knows
too
well
how
people
stuff
one
with
fine
words
and
will
not
let
itself
be
satisfied
with
the
barmecide
dish

but
they
are
bound
to
have
their
play
ground
for
they
are
children
you
know
and
cannot
be
so
staid
as
old
folks
boys
will
be
boys
only
for
this
play
ground
only
for
a
few
hours
of
jolly
running
about
they
bargain
they
ask
only
that
the
state
should
not
like
a
splenetic
papa
be
too
cross
it
should
permit
some
processions
of
the
ass
and
plays
of
fools
as
the
church
allowed
them
in
the
middle
ages
but
the
times
when
it
could
grant
this
without
danger
are
past
children
that
now
once
come
into
the
open
and
live
through
an
hour
without
the
rod
of
discipline
are
no
longer
willing
to
go
into
the
cell
for
the
open
is
now
no
longer
a
supplement
to
the
cell
no
longer
a
refreshing
recreation
but
its
opposite
an
aut
aut
in
short
the
state
must
either
no
longer
put
up
with
anything
or
put
up
with
everything
and
perish
it
must
be
either
sensitive
through
and
through
or
like
a
dead
man
insensitive
tolerance
is
done
with
if
the
state
but
gives
a
finger
they
take
the
whole
hand
at
once
there
can
be
no
more
jesting
and
all
jest
such
as
fun
wit
humour
becomes
bitter
earnest
the
clamour
of
the
liberals
for
freedom
of
the
press
runs
counter
to
their
own
principle
their
proper
will
they
will
what
they
do
not
will
they
wish
they
would
like
hence
it
is
too
that
they
fall
away
so
easily
when
once
so
called
freedom
of
the
press
appears
then
they
would
like
censorship
quite
naturally
the
state
is
sacred
even
to
them
likewise
morals
they
behave
toward
it
only
as
ill
bred
brats
as
tricky
children
who
seek
to
utilize
the
weaknesses
of
their
parents
papa
state
is
to
permit
them
to
say
many
things
that
do
not
please
him
but
papa
has
the
right
by
a
stern
look
to
blue
pencil
their
impertinent
gabble
if
they
recognize
in
him
their
papa
they
must
in
his
presence
put
up
with
the
censorship
of
speech
like
every
child

if
you
let
yourself
be
made
out
in
the
right
by
another
you
must
no
less
let
yourself
be
made
out
in
the
wrong
by
him
if
justification
and
reward
come
to
you
from
him
expect
also
his
arraignment
and
punishment
alongside
right
goes
wrong
alongside
legality
crime
what
are
you
q
you
are
a
criminal
the
criminal
is
in
the
utmost
degree
the
states
own
crime
says
bettina

one
may
let
this
sentiment
pass
even
if
bettina
herself
does
not
understand
it
exactly
so
for
in
the
state
the
unbridled
i
q
i
as
i
belong
to
myself
alone
q
cannot
come
to
my
fulfilment
and
realization
every
ego
is
from
birth
a
criminal
to
begin
with
against
the
people
the
state
hence
it
is
that
it
does
really
keep
watch
over
all
it
sees
in
each
one
an
q
egoist
and
it
is
afraid
of
the
egoist
it
presumes
the
worst
about
each
one
and
takes
care
police
care
that
no
harm
happens
to
the
state
ne
quid
respublica
detrimenti
capiat
the
unbridled
ego
q
and
this
we
originally
are
and
in
our
secret
inward
parts
we
remain
so
always
q
is
the
never
ceasing
criminal
in
the
state
the
man
whom
his
boldness
his
will
his
inconsiderateness
and
fearlessness
lead
is
surrounded
with
spies
by
the
state
by
the
people
i
say
by
the
people
the
people
think
it
something
wonderful
you
good
hearted
folks
what
you
have
in
the
people
q
the
people
is
full
of
police
sentiments
through
and
through
q
only
he
who
renounces
his
ego
who
practices
self
renunciation
is
acceptable
to
the
people
in
the
book
cited
bettina
is
throughout
good
natured
enough
to
regard
the
state
as
only
sick
and
to
hope
for
its
recovery
a
recovery
which
she
would
bring
about
through
the
demagogues

but
it
is
not
sick
rather
is
it
in
its
full
strength
when
it
puts
from
it
the
demagogues
who
want
to
acquire
something
for
the
individuals
for
all
in
its
believers
it
is
provided
with
the
best
demagogues
leaders
of
the
people
according
to
bettina
the
state
is
to
develop
mankinds
germ
of
freedom
otherwise
it
is
a
raven
mother
and
caring
for
raven
fodder
it
cannot
do
otherwise
for
in
its
very
caring
for
mankind
which
besides
would
have
to
be
the
humane
or
free
state
to
begin
with
the
individual
is
raven
fodder
for
it
how
rightly
speaks
the
burgomaster
on
the
other
hand

what
the
state
has
no
other
duty
than
to
be
merely
the
attendant
of
incurable
invalids
q
that
isnt
to
the
point
from
of
old
the
healthy
state
has
relieved
itself
of
the
diseased
matter
and
not
mixed
itself
with
it
it
does
not
need
to
be
so
economical
with
its
juices
cut
off
the
robber
branches
without
hesitation
that
the
others
may
bloom
q
do
not
shiver
at
the
states
harshness
its
morality
its
policy
and
religion
point
it
to
that
accuse
it
of
no
want
of
feeling
its
sympathy
revolts
against
this
but
its
experience
finds
safety
only
in
this
severity
there
are
diseases
in
which
only
drastic
remedies
will
help
the
physician
who
recognizes
the
disease
as
such
but
timidly
turns
to
palliatives
will
never
remove
the
disease
but
may
well
cause
the
patient
to
succumb
after
a
shorter
or
longer
sickness
frau
rats
question
if
you
apply
death
as
a
drastic
remedy
how
is
the
cure
to
be
wrought
then
isnt
to
the
point
why
the
state
does
not
apply
death
against
itself
but
against
an
offensive
member
it
tears
out
an
eye
that
offends
it
etc
for
the
invalid
state
the
only
way
of
salvation
is
to
make
man
flourish
in
it

if
one
here
like
bettina
understand
by
man
the
concept
man
she
is
right
the
invalid
state
will
recover
by
the
flourishing
of
man
for
the
more
infatuated
the
individuals
are
with
man
the
better
it
serves
the
states
turn
but
if
one
referred
it
to
the
individuals
to
all
and
the
authoress
half
does
this
too
because
about
man
she
is
still
involved
in
vagueness
then
it
would
sound
somewhat
like
the
following
for
an
invalid
band
of
robbers
the
only
way
of
salvation
is
to
make
the
loyal
citizen
nourish
in
it
why
thereby
the
band
of
robbers
would
simply
go
to
ruin
as
a
band
of
robbers
and
because
it
perceives
this
it
prefers
to
shoot
every
one
who
has
a
leaning
toward
becoming
a
steady
man
in
this
book
bettina
is
a
patriot
or
what
is
little
more
a
philantropist
a
worker
for
human
happiness
she
is
discontented
with
the
existing
order
in
quite
the
same
way
as
is
the
title
ghost
of
her
book
along
with
all
who
would
like
to
bring
back
the
good
old
faith
and
what
goes
with
it
only
she
thinks
contrariwise
that
the
politicians
place
holders
and
diplomats
ruined
the
state
while
those
lay
it
at
the
door
of
the
malevolent
the
seducers
of
the
people
what
is
the
ordinary
criminal
but
one
who
has
committed
the
fatal
mistake
of
endeavouring
after
what
is
the
peoples
instead
of
seeking
for
what
is
his
he
has
sought
despicable
alien
goods
has
done
what
believers
do
who
seek
after
what
is
gods
what
does
the
priest
who
admonishes
the
criminal
do
he
sets
before
him
the
great
wrong
of
having
desecrated
by
his
act
what
was
hallowed
by
the
state
its
property
in
which
of
course
must
be
included
even
the
life
of
those
who
belong
to
the
state
instead
of
this
he
might
rather
hold
up
to
him
the
fact
that
he
has
befouled
himself
in
not
despising
the
alien
thing
but
thinking
it
worth
stealing
he
could
if
he
were
not
a
parson
talk
with
the
so
called
criminal
as
with
an
egoist
and
he
will
be
ashamed
not
that
he
transgressed
against
your
laws
and
goods
but
that
he
considered
your
laws
worth
evading
your
goods
worth
desiring
he
will
be
ashamed
that
he
did
not
q
despise
you
and
yours
together
that
he
was
too
little
an
egoist
but
you
cannot
talk
egoistically
with
him
for
you
are
not
so
great
as
a
criminal
you
q
commit
no
crime
you
do
not
know
that
an
ego
who
is
his
own
cannot
desist
from
being
a
criminal
that
crime
is
his
life
and
yet
you
should
know
it
since
you
believe
that
we
are
all
miserable
sinners
but
you
think
surreptitiously
to
get
beyond
sin
you
do
not
comprehend
q
for
you
are
devil
fearing
q
that
guilt
is
the
value
of
a
man
oh
if
you
were
guilty
but
now
you
are
righteous

well
q
just
put
every
thing
nicely
to
rights
for
your
master
when
the
christian
consciousness
or
the
christian
man
draws
up
a
criminal
code
what
can
the
concept
of
crime
be
there
but
simply
q
heartlessness
each
severing
and
wounding
of
a
heart
relation
each
heartless
behaviour
toward
a
sacred
being
is
crime
the
more
heartfelt
the
relation
is
supposed
to
be
the
more
scandalous
is
the
deriding
of
it
and
the
more
worthy
of
punishment
the
crime
everyone
who
is
subject
to
the
lord
should
love
him
to
deny
this
love
is
a
high
treason
worthy
of
death
adultery
is
a
heartlessness
worthy
of
punishment
one
has
no
heart
no
enthusiasm
no
pathetic
feeling
for
the
sacredness
of
marriage
so
long
as
the
heart
or
soul
dictates
laws
only
the
heartful
or
soulful
man
enjoys
the
protection
of
the
laws
that
the
man
of
soul
makes
laws
means
properly
that
the
moral
man
makes
them
what
contradicts
these
mens
moral
feeling
this
they
penalize
how
should
disloyalty
secession
breach
of
oaths
q
in
short
all
radical
breaking
off
all
tearing
asunder
of
venerable
ties
q
not
be
flagitious
and
criminal
in
their
eyes
he
who
breaks
with
these
demands
of
the
soul
has
for
enemies
all
the
moral
all
the
men
of
soul
only
krummacher
and
his
mates
are
the
right
people
to
set
up
consistently
a
penal
code
of
the
heart
as
a
certain
bill
sufficiently
proves
the
consistent
legislation
of
the
christian
state
must
be
placed
wholly
in
the
hands
of
the
q
parsons
and
will
not
become
pure
and
coherent
so
long
as
it
is
worked
out
only
by
q
the
parson
ridden
who
are
always
only
half
parsons
only
then
will
every
lack
of
soulfulness
every
heartlessness
be
certified
as
an
unpardonable
crime
only
then
will
every
agitation
of
the
soul
become
condemnable
every
objection
of
criticism
and
doubt
be
anathematized
only
then
is
the
own
man
before
the
christian
consciousness
a
convicted
q
criminal
to
begin
with
the
men
of
the
revolution
often
talked
of
the
peoples
just
revenge
as
its
right
revenge
and
right
coincide
here
is
this
an
attitude
of
an
ego
to
an
ego
the
people
cries
that
the
opposite
party
has
committed
crimes
against
it
can
i
assume
that
one
commits
a
crime
against
me
without
assuming
that
he
has
to
act
as
i
see
fit
and
this
action
i
call
the
right
the
good
etc
the
divergent
action
a
crime
so
i
think
that
the
others
must
aim
at
the
same
goal
with
me
i
do
not
treat
them
as
unique
beings
who
bear
their
law
in
themselves
and
live
according
to
it
but
as
beings
who
are
to
obey
some
rational
law
i
set
up
what
man
is
and
what
acting
in
a
truly
human
way
is
and
i
demand
of
every
one
that
this
law
become
norm
and
ideal
to
him
otherwise
he
will
expose
himself
as
a
sinner
and
criminal
but
upon
the
guilty
falls
the
penalty
of
the
law
one
sees
here
how
it
is
man
again
who
sets
on
foot
even
the
concept
of
crime
of
sin
and
therewith
that
of
right
a
man
in
whom
i
do
not
recognize
man
is
sinner
a
guilty
one
only
against
a
sacred
thing
are
there
criminals
you
against
me
can
never
be
a
criminal
but
only
an
opponent
but
not
to
hate
him
who
injures
a
sacred
thing
is
in
itself
a
crime
as
st
just
cries
out
against
danton

are
you
not
a
criminal
and
responsible
for
not
having
hated
the
enemies
of
the
fatherland
q
if
as
in
the
revolution
what
man
is
is
apprehended
as
good
citizen
then
from
this
concept
of
man
we
have
the
well
known
political
offences
and
crimes
in
all
this
the
individual
the
individual
man
is
regarded
as
refuse
and
on
the
other
hand
the
general
man
man
is
honoured
now
according
to
how
this
ghost
is
named
q
as
christian
jew
mussulman
good
citizen
loyal
subject
freeman
patriot
etc
q
just
so
do
those
who
would
like
to
carry
through
a
divergent
concept
of
man
as
well
as
those
who
want
to
put
themselves
through
fall
before
victorious
man
and
with
what
unction
the
butchery
goes
on
here
in
the
name
of
the
law
of
the
sovereign
people
of
god
etc
now
if
the
persecuted
trickily
conceal
and
protect
themselves
from
the
stern
parsonical
judges
people
stigmatize
them
as
st
just
does
those
whom
he
accuses
in
the
speech
against
danton
one
is
to
be
a
fool
and
deliver
himself
up
to
their
moloch
crimes
spring
from
fixed
ideas
the
sacredness
of
marriage
is
a
fixed
idea
from
the
sacredness
it
follows
that
infidelity
is
a
crime
and
therefore
a
certain
marriage
law
imposes
upon
it
a
shorter
or
longer
penalty
but
by
those
who
proclaim
freedom
as
sacred
this
penalty
must
be
regarded
as
a
crime
against
freedom
and
only
in
this
sense
has
public
opinion
in
fact
branded
the
marriage
law
society
would
have
every
one
come
to
his
right
indeed
but
yet
only
to
that
which
is
sanctioned
by
society
to
the
society
right
not
really
to
his
right
but
i
give
or
take
to
myself
the
right
out
of
my
own
plenitude
of
power
and
against
every
superior
power
i
am
the
most
impenitent
criminal
owner
and
creator
of
my
right
i
recognize
no
other
source
of
right
than
q
me
neither
god
nor
the
state
nor
nature
nor
even
man
himself
with
his
eternal
rights
of
man
neither
divine
nor
human
right
right
in
and
for
itself
without
relation
to
me
therefore
absolute
right
separated
from
me
therefore
a
thing
that
exists
in
and
for
itself
an
absolute
an
eternal
right
like
an
eternal
truth
according
to
the
liberal
way
of
thinking
right
is
to
be
obligatory
for
me
because
it
is
thus
established
by
human
reason
against
which
my
reason
is
unreason
formerly
people
inveighed
in
the
name
of
divine
reason
against
weak
human
reason
now
in
the
name
of
strong
human
reason
against
egoistic
reason
which
is
rejected
as
unreason
and
yet
none
is
real
but
this
very
unreason
neither
divine
nor
human
reason
but
only
your
and
my
reason
existing
at
any
given
time
is
real
as
and
because
you
and
i
are
real
the
thought
of
right
is
originally
my
thought
or
it
has
its
origin
in
me
but
when
it
has
sprung
from
me
when
the
word
is
out
then
it
has
become
flesh
it
is
a
fixed
idea
now
i
no
longer
get
rid
of
the
thought
however
i
turn
it
stands
before
me
thus
men
have
not
become
masters
again
of
the
thought
right
which
they
themselves
created
their
creature
is
running
away
with
them
this
is
absolute
right
that
which
is
absolved
or
unfastened
from
me
we
revering
it
as
absolute
cannot
devour
it
again
and
it
takes
from
us
the
creative
power
the
creature
is
more
than
the
creator
it
is
in
and
for
itself
once
you
no
longer
let
right
run
around
free
once
you
draw
it
back
into
its
origin
into
you
it
is
your
right
and
that
is
right
which
suits
you
right
has
had
to
suffer
an
attack
within
itself
from
the
stand
point
of
right
war
being
declared
on
the
part
of
liberalism
against
privilege

privileged
and
endowed
with
equal
rights
q
on
these
two
concepts
turns
a
stubborn
fight
excluded
or
admitted
q
would
mean
the
same
but
where
should
there
be
a
power
q
be
it
an
imaginary
one
like
god
law
or
a
real
one
like
i
you
q
of
which
it
should
not
be
true
that
before
it
all
are
endowed
with
equal
rights
that
is
no
respect
of
persons
holds
every
one
is
equally
dear
to
god
if
he
adores
him
equally
agreeable
to
the
law
if
only
he
is
a
law
abiding
person
whether
the
lover
of
god
and
the
law
is
humpbacked
and
lame
whether
poor
or
rich
and
the
like
that
amounts
to
nothing
for
god
and
the
law
just
so
when
you
are
at
the
point
of
drowning
you
like
a
negro
as
rescuer
as
well
as
the
most
excellent
caucasia
n
q
yes
in
this
situation
you
esteem
a
dog
not
less
than
a
man
but
to
whom
will
not
every
one
be
also
contrariwise
a
preferred
or
disregarded
person
god
punishes
the
wicked
with
his
wrath
the
law
chastises
the
lawless
you
let
one
visit
you
every
moment
and
show
the
other
the
door
the
equality
of
right
is
a
phantom
just
because
right
is
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
than
admission
a
matter
of
grace
which
be
it
said
one
may
also
acquire
by
his
desert
for
desert
and
grace
are
not
contradictory
since
even
grace
wishes
to
be
deserved
and
our
gracious
smile
falls
only
to
him
who
knows
how
to
force
it
from
us
so
people
dream
of
all
citizens
of
the
state
having
to
stand
side
by
side
with
equal
rights
as
citizens
of
the
state
they
are
certainly
all
equal
for
the
state
but
it
will
divide
them
and
advance
them
or
put
them
in
the
rear
according
to
its
special
ends
if
on
no
other
account
and
still
more
must
it
distinguish
them
from
one
another
as
good
and
bad
citizens
bruno
bauer
disposes
of
the
jew
question
from
the
stand
point
that
privilege
is
not
justified
because
jew
and
christian
have
each
some
point
of
advantage
over
the
other
and
in
having
this
point
of
advantage
are
exclusive
therefore
before
the
critics
gaze
they
crumble
into
nothingness
with
them
the
state
lies
under
the
like
blame
since
it
justifies
their
having
advantages
and
stamps
it
as
a
privilege
or
prerogative
but
thereby
derogates
from
its
calling
to
become
a
free
state
but
now
every
one
has
something
of
advantage
over
another
q
to
wit
himself
or
his
individuality
in
this
everybody
remains
exclusive
and
again
before
a
third
party
every
one
makes
his
peculiarity
count
for
as
much
as
possible
and
if
he
wants
to
win
him
at
all
tries
to
make
it
appear
attractive
before
him
now
is
the
third
party
to
be
insensible
to
the
difference
of
the
one
from
the
other
do
they
ask
that
of
the
free
state
or
of
humanity
then
these
would
have
to
be
absolutely
without
self
interest
and
incapable
of
taking
an
interest
in
any
one
whatever
neither
god
who
divides
his
own
from
the
wicked
nor
the
state
which
knows
how
to
separate
good
citizens
from
bad
was
thought
of
as
so
indifferent
but
they
are
looking
for
this
very
third
party
that
bestows
no
more
privilege
then
it
is
called
perhaps
the
free
state
or
humanity
or
whatever
else
it
may
be
as
christian
and
jew
are
ranked
low
by
bruno
bauer
on
account
of
their
asserting
privileges
it
must
be
that
they
could
and
should
free
themselves
from
their
narrow
stand
point
by
self
renunciation
or
unselfishness
if
they
threw
off
their
egoism
the
mutual
wrong
would
cease
and
with
it
christian
and
jewish
religiousness
in
general
it
would
be
necessary
only
that
neither
of
them
should
any
longer
want
to
be
anything
peculiar
but
if
they
gave
up
this
exclusiveness
with
that
the
ground
on
which
their
hostilities
were
waged
would
in
truth
not
yet
be
forsaken
in
case
of
need
they
would
indeed
find
a
third
thing
on
which
they
could
unite
a
general
religion
a
religion
of
humanity
and
the
like
in
short
an
equalization
which
need
not
be
better
than
that
which
would
result
if
all
jews
became
christians
by
this
likewise
the
privilege
of
one
over
the
other
would
have
an
end
the
tension

would
indeed
be
done
away
but
in
this
consisted
not
the
essence
of
the
two
but
only
their
neighbourhood
as
being
distinguished
from
each
other
they
must
necessarily
be
mutually
resistant

and
the
disparity
will
always
remain
truly
it
is
not
a
failing
in
you
that
you
stiffen
yourself
against
me
and
assert
your
distinctness
or
peculiarity
you
need
not
give
way
or
renounce
yourself
people
conceive
the
significance
of
the
opposition
too
formally
and
weakly
when
they
want
only
to
dissolve
it
in
order
to
make
room
for
a
third
thing
that
shall
unite
the
opposition
deserves
rather
to
be
sharpened
as
jew
and
christian
you
are
in
too
slight
an
opposition
and
are
contending
only
about
religion
as
it
were
about
the
emperors
beard
about
a
fiddle
sticks
end
enemies
in
religion
indeed
in
the
rest
you
still
remain
good
friends
and
equal
to
each
other
as
men
nevertheless
the
rest
too
is
unlike
in
each
and
the
time
when
you
no
longer
merely
dissemble
your
opposition
will
be
only
when
you
entirely
recognize
it
and
everybody
asserts
himself
from
top
to
toe
as
unique

then
the
former
opposition
will
assuredly
be
dissolved
but
only
because
a
stronger
has
taken
it
up
into
itself
our
weakness
consists
not
in
this
that
we
are
in
opposition
to
others
but
in
this
that
we
are
not
completely
so
that
we
are
not
entirely
severed
from
them
or
that
we
seek
a
communion
a
bond
that
in
communion
we
have
an
ideal
one
faith
one
god
one
idea
one
hat
for
all
if
all
were
brought
under
one
hat
certainly
no
one
would
any
longer
need
to
take
off
his
hat
before
another
the
last
and
most
decided
opposition
that
of
unique
against
unique
is
at
bottom
beyond
what
is
called
opposition
but
without
having
sunk
back
into
unity
and
unison
as
unique
you
have
nothing
in
common
with
the
other
any
longer
and
therefore
nothing
divisive
or
hostile
either
you
are
not
seeking
to
be
in
the
right
against
him
before
a
third
party
and
are
standing
with
him
neither
on
the
ground
of
right
nor
on
any
other
common
ground
the
opposition
vanishes
in
complete
q
severance
or
singleness

this
might
indeed
be
regarded
as
the
new
point
in
common
or
a
new
parity
but
here
the
parity
consists
precisely
in
the
disparity
and
is
itself
nothing
but
disparity
a
par
of
disparity
and
that
only
for
him
who
institutes
a
comparison
the
polemic
against
privilege
forms
a
characteristic
feature
of
liberalism
which
fumes
against
privilege
because
it
itself
appeals
to
right
further
than
to
fuming
it
cannot
carry
this
for
privileges
do
not
fall
before
right
falls
as
they
are
only
forms
of
right
but
right
falls
apart
into
its
nothingness
when
it
is
swallowed
up
by
might
when
one
understands
what
is
meant
by
might
goes
before
right
all
right
explains
itself
then
as
privilege
and
privilege
itself
as
power
as
q
superior
power
but
must
not
the
mighty
combat
against
superior
power
show
quite
another
face
than
the
modest
combat
against
privilege
which
is
to
be
fought
out
before
a
first
judge
right
according
to
the
judges
mind

now
in
conclusion
i
have
still
to
take
back
the
half
way
form
of
expression
of
which
i
was
willing
to
make
use
only
so
long
as
i
was
still
rooting
among
the
entrails
of
right
and
letting
the
word
at
least
stand
but
in
fact
with
the
concept
the
word
too
loses
its
meaning
what
i
called
my
right
is
no
longer
right
at
all
because
right
can
be
bestowed
only
by
a
spirit
be
it
the
spirit
of
nature
or
that
of
the
species
of
mankind
the
spirit
of
god
or
that
of
his
holiness
or
his
highness
etc
what
i
have
without
an
entitling
spirit
i
have
without
right
i
have
it
solely
and
alone
through
my
power
i
do
not
demand
any
right
therefore
i
need
not
recognize
any
either
what
i
can
get
by
force
i
get
by
force
and
what
i
do
not
get
by
force
i
have
no
right
to
nor
do
i
give
myself
airs
or
consolation
with
my
imprescriptible
right
with
absolute
right
right
itself
passes
away
the
dominion
of
the
concept
of
right
is
cancelled
at
the
same
time
for
it
is
not
to
be
forgotten
that
hitherto
concepts
ideas
or
principles
ruled
us
and
that
among
these
rulers
the
concept
of
right
or
of
justice
played
one
of
the
most
important
parts
entitled
or
unentitled
q
that
does
not
concern
me
if
i
am
only
powerful
i
am
of
myself
empowered
and
need
no
other
empowering
or
entitling
right
q
is
a
wheel
in
the
head
put
there
by
a
spook
power
q
that
am
i
myself
i
am
the
powerful
one
and
owner
of
power
right
is
above
me
is
absolute
and
exists
in
one
higher
as
whose
grace
it
flows
to
me
right
is
a
gift
of
grace
from
the
judge
power
and
might
exist
only
in
me
the
powerful
and
mighty
b
my
intercourse
in
society
the
human
demand
at
most
can
be
satisfied
while
the
egoistic
must
always
come
short
because
it
can
hardly
escape
anybody
that
the
present
shows
no
such
living
interest
in
any
question
as
in
the
social
one
has
to
direct
his
gaze
especially
to
society
nay
if
the
interest
felt
in
it
were
less
passionate
and
dazzled
people
would
not
so
much
in
looking
at
society
lose
sight
of
the
individuals
in
it
and
would
recognize
that
a
society
cannot
become
new
so
long
as
those
who
form
and
constitute
it
remain
the
old
ones
if
for
example
there
was
to
arise
in
the
jewish
people
a
society
which
should
spread
a
new
faith
over
the
earth
these
apostles
could
in
no
case
remain
pharisees
as
you
are
so
you
present
yourself
so
you
behave
toward
men
a
hypocrite
as
a
hypocrite
a
christian
as
a
christian
therefore
the
character
of
a
society
is
determined
by
the
character
of
its
members
they
are
its
creators
so
much
at
least
one
must
perceive
even
if
one
were
not
willing
to
put
to
the
test
the
concept
society
itself
ever
far
from
letting
themselves
come
to
their
full
development
and
consequence
men
have
hitherto
not
been
able
to
found
their
societies
on
themselves
or
rather
they
have
been
able
only
to
found
societies
and
to
live
in
societies
the
societies
were
always
persons
powerful
persons
so
called
moral
persons
ghosts
before
which
the
individual
had
the
appropriate
wheel
in
his
head
the
fear
of
ghosts
as
such
ghosts
they
may
most
suitably
be
designated
by
the
respective
names
people
and
peoplet
the
people
of
the
patriarchs
the
people
of
the
hellenes
etc
at
last
the
q
people
of
men
mankind
anacharsis
cloots
was
enthusiastic
for
the
nation
of
mankind
then
every
subdivision
of
this
people
which
could
and
must
have
its
special
societies
the
spanish
french
people
etc
within
it
again
classes
cities
in
short
all
kinds
of
corporations
lastly
tapering
to
the
finest
point
the
little
peoplet
of
the
family
hence
instead
of
saying
that
the
person
that
walked
as
ghost
in
all
societies
hitherto
has
been
the
people
there
might
also
have
been
named
the
two
extremes
q
to
wit
either
mankind
or
the
family
both
the
most
natural
born
units
we
choose
the
word
people

because
its
derivation
has
been
brought
into
connection
with
the
greek
polloi
the
many
or
the
masses
but
still
more
because
national
efforts
are
at
present
the
order
of
the
day
and
because
even
the
newest
mutineers
have
not
yet
shaken
off
this
deceptive
person
although
on
the
other
hand
the
latter
consideration
must
give
the
preference
to
the
expression
mankind
since
on
all
sides
they
are
going
in
for
enthusiasm
over
mankind
the
people
then
q
mankind
or
the
family
q
have
hitherto
as
it
seems
played
history
no
egoistic
interest
was
to
come
up
in
these
societies
but
solely
general
ones
national
or
popular
interests
class
interests
family
interests
and
general
human
interests
but
who
has
brought
to
their
fall
the
peoples
whose
decline
history
relates
who
but
the
egoist
who
was
seeking
his
satisfaction
if
once
an
egoistic
interest
crept
in
the
society
was
corrupted
and
moved
toward
its
dissolution
as
rome
proves
with
its
highly
developed
system
of
private
rights
or
christianity
with
the
incessantly
breaking
in
rational
self
determination
self
consciousness
the
autonomy
of
the
spirit
and
so
on
the
christian
people
has
produced
two
societies
whose
duration
will
keep
equal
measure
with
the
permanence
of
that
people
these
are
the
societies
state
and
church
can
they
be
called
a
union
of
egoists
do
we
in
them
pursue
an
egoistic
personal
own
interest
or
do
we
pursue
a
popular
an
interest
of
the
christian
people
to
wit
a
state
and
church
interest
can
i
and
may
i
be
myself
in
them
may
i
think
and
act
as
i
will
may
i
reveal
myself
live
myself
out
busy
myself
must
i
not
leave
untouched
the
majesty
of
the
state
the
sanctity
of
the
church
well
i
may
not
do
so
as
i
will
but
shall
i
find
in
any
society
such
an
unmeasured
freedom
of
maying
certainly
no
accordingly
we
might
be
content
not
a
bit
it
is
a
different
thing
whether
i
rebound
from
an
ego
or
from
a
people
a
generalization
there
i
am
my
opponents
opponent
born
his
equal
here
i
am
a
despised
opponent
bound
and
under
a
guardian
there
i
stand
man
to
man
here
i
am
a
schoolboy
who
can
accomplish
nothing
against
his
comrade
because
the
latter
has
called
father
and
mother
to
aid
and
has
crept
under
the
apron
while
i
am
well
scolded
as
an
ill
bred
brat
and
i
must
not
argue
there
i
fight
against
a
bodily
enemy
here
against
mankind
against
a
generalization
against
a
majesty
against
a
spook
but
to
me
no
majesty
nothing
sacred
is
a
limit
nothing
that
i
know
how
to
overpower
only
that
which
i
cannot
overpower
still
limits
my
might
and
i
of
limited
might
am
temporarily
a
limited
i
not
limited
by
the
might
outside
me
but
limited
by
my
own
still
deficient
might
by
my
own
impotence
however
the
guard
dies
but
does
not
surrender
above
all
only
a
bodily
opponent
i
dare
meet
every
foeman
whom
i
can
see
and
measure
with
my
eye
whose
mettle
fires
my
mettle
for
the
fight
etc
many
privileges
have
indeed
been
cancelled
with
time
but
solely
for
the
sake
of
the
common
weal
of
the
state
and
the
states
weal
by
no
means
for
the
strengthening
of
me
vassalage
was
abrogated
only
that
a
single
liege
lord
the
lord
of
the
people
the
monarchical
power
might
be
strengthened
vassalage
under
the
one
became
yet
more
rigourous
thereby
only
in
favour
of
the
monarch
be
he
called
prince
or
law
have
privileges
fallen
in
france
the
citizens
are
not
indeed
vassals
of
the
king
but
are
instead
vassals
of
the
law
the
charter
subordination
was
retained
only
the
christian
state
recognized
that
man
cannot
serve
two
masters
the
lord
of
the
manor
and
the
prince
therefore
one
obtained
all
the
prerogatives
now
he
can
again
place
one
above
another
he
can
make
men
in
high
place
but
of
what
concern
to
me
is
the
common
weal
the
common
weal
as
such
is
not
my
weal
but
only
the
furthest
extremity
of
self
renunciation
the
common
weal
may
cheer
aloud
while
i
must
down

the
state
may
shine
while
i
starve
in
what
lies
the
folly
of
the
political
liberals
but
in
their
opposing
the
people
to
the
government
and
talking
of
peoples
rights
so
there
is
the
people
going
to
be
of
age
etc
as
if
one
who
has
no
mouth
could
be
mndig

only
the
individual
is
able
to
be
mndig
thus
the
whole
question
of
the
liberty
of
the
press
is
turned
upside
down
when
it
is
laid
claim
to
as
a
right
of
the
people
it
is
only
a
right
or
better
the
might
of
the
individual
if
a
people
has
liberty
of
the
press
then
i
although
in
the
midst
of
this
people
have
it
not
a
liberty
of
the
people
is
not
my
liberty
and
the
liberty
of
the
press
as
a
liberty
of
the
people
must
have
at
its
side
a
press
law
directed
against
me
this
must
be
insisted
on
all
around
against
the
present
day
efforts
for
liberty
liberty
of
the
people
is
not
my
liberty
let
us
admit
these
categories
liberty
of
the
people
and
right
of
the
people
for
example
the
right
of
the
people
that
everybody
may
bear
arms
does
one
not
forfeit
such
a
right
one
cannot
forfeit
his
own
right
but
may
well
forfeit
a
right
that
belongs
not
to
me
but
to
the
people
i
may
be
locked
up
for
the
sake
of
the
liberty
of
the
people
i
may
under
sentence
incur
the
loss
of
the
right
to
bear
arms
liberalism
appears
as
the
last
attempt
at
a
creation
of
the
liberty
of
the
people
a
liberty
of
the
commune
of
society
of
the
general
of
mankind
the
dream
of
a
humanity
a
people
a
commune
a
society
that
shall
be
of
age
a
people
cannot
be
free
otherwise
than
at
the
individuals
expense
for
it
is
not
the
individual
that
is
the
main
point
in
this
liberty
but
the
people
the
freer
the
people
the
more
bound
the
individual
the
athenian
people
precisely
at
its
freest
time
created
ostracism
banished
the
atheists
poisoned
the
most
honest
thinker
how
they
do
praise
socrates
for
his
conscientiousness
which
makes
him
resist
the
advice
to
get
away
from
the
dungeon
he
is
a
fool
that
he
concedes
to
the
athenians
a
right
to
condemn
him
therefore
it
certainly
serves
him
right
why
then
does
he
remain
standing
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
athenians
why
does
he
not
break
with
them
had
he
known
and
been
able
to
know
what
he
was
he
would
have
conceded
to
such
judges
no
claim
no
right
that
he
did
not
escape
was
just
his
weakness
his
delusion
of
still
having
something
in
common
with
the
athenians
or
the
opinion
that
he
was
a
member
a
mere
member
of
this
people
but
he
was
rather
this
people
itself
in
person
and
could
only
be
his
own
judge
there
was
no
judge
over
him
as
he
himself
had
really
pronounced
a
public
sentence
on
himself
and
rated
himself
worthy
of
the
prytaneum
he
should
have
stuck
to
that
and
as
he
had
uttered
no
sentence
of
death
against
himself
should
have
despised
that
of
the
athenians
too
and
escaped
but
he
subordinated
himself
and
recognized
in
the
people
his
judge
he
seemed
little
to
himself
before
the
majesty
of
the
people
that
he
subjected
himself
to
might
to
which
alone
he
could
succumb
as
to
a
right
was
treason
against
himself
it
was
virtue
to
christ
who
it
is
alleged
refrained
from
using
the
power
over
his
heavenly
legions
the
same
scrupulousness
is
thereby
ascribed
by
the
narrators
luther
did
very
well
and
wisely
to
have
the
safety
of
his
journey
to
worms
warranted
to
him
in
black
and
white
and
socrates
should
have
known
that
the
athenians
were
his
enemies
he
alone
his
judge
the
self
deception
of
a
reign
of
law
etc
should
have
given
way
to
the
perception
that
the
relation
was
a
relation
of
might
it
was
with
pettifoggery
and
intrigues
that
greek
liberty
ended
why
because
the
ordinary
greeks
could
still
less
attain
that
logical
conclusion
which
not
even
their
hero
of
thought
socrates
was
able
to
draw
what
then
is
pettifoggery
but
a
way
of
utilizing
something
established
without
doing
away
with
it
i
might
add
for
ones
own
advantage
but
you
see
that
lies
in
utilizing
such
pettifoggers
are
the
theologians
who
wrest
and
force
gods
word
what
would
they
have
to
wrest
if
it
were
not
for
the
established
word
of
god
so
those
liberals
who
only
shake
and
wrest
the
established
order
they
are
all
perverters
like
those
perverters
of
the
law
socrates
recognized
law
right
the
greeks
constantly
retained
the
authority
of
right
and
law
if
with
this
recognition
they
wanted
nevertheless
to
assert
their
advantage
every
one
his
own
then
they
had
to
seek
it
in
perversion
of
the
law
or
intrigue
alcibiades
an
intriguer
of
genius
introduces
the
period
of
athenian
decay
the
spartan
lysander
and
others
show
that
intrigue
had
become
universally
greek
greek
law
on
which
the
greek
states
rested
had
to
be
perverted
and
undermined
by
the
egoists
within
these
states
and
the
states
went
down
that
the
individuals
might
become
free
the
greek
people
fell
because
the
individuals
cared
less
for
this
people
than
for
themselves
in
general
all
states
constitutions
churches
have
sunk
by
the
secession
of
individuals
for
the
individual
is
the
irreconcilable
enemy
of
every
generality
every
tie
every
fetter
yet
people
fancy
to
this
day
that
man
needs
sacred
ties
he
the
deadly
enemy
of
every
tie
the
history
of
the
world
shows
that
no
tie
has
yet
remained
unrent
shows
that
man
tirelessly
defends
himself
against
ties
of
every
sort
and
yet
blinded
people
think
up
new
ties
again
and
again
and
think
that
they
have
arrived
at
the
right
one
if
one
puts
upon
them
the
tie
of
a
so
called
free
constitution
a
beautiful
constitutional
tie
decoration
ribbons
the
ties
of
confidence
between
q
q
q
do
seem
gradually
to
have
become
somewhat
infirm
but
people
have
made
no
further
progress
than
from
apron
strings
to
garters
and
collars
everything
sacred
is
a
tie
a
fetter
everything
sacred
is
and
must
be
perverted
by
perverters
of
the
law
therefore
our
present
time
has
multitudes
of
such
perverters
in
all
spheres
they
are
preparing
the
way
for
the
break
up
of
law
for
lawlessness
poor
athenians
who
are
accused
of
pettifoggery
and
sophistry
poor
alcibiades
of
intrigue
why
that
was
just
your
best
point
your
first
step
in
freedom
your
aeschylus
herodotus
etc
only
wanted
to
have
a
free
greek
people
you
were
the
first
to
surmise
something
of
your
freedom
a
people
represses
those
who
tower
above
its
majesty
by
ostracism
against
too
powerful
citizens
by
the
inquisition
against
the
heretics
of
the
church
by
the
q
inquisition
against
traitors
in
the
state
for
the
people
is
concerned
only
with
its
self
assertion
it
demands
patriotic
self
sacrifice
from
everybody
to
it
accordingly
every
one
in
himself
is
indifferent
a
nothing
and
it
cannot
do
not
even
suffer
what
the
individual
and
he
alone
must
do
q
to
wit
turn
him
to
account
every
people
every
state
is
unjust
toward
the
egoist
as
long
as
there
still
exists
even
one
institution
which
the
individual
may
not
dissolve
the
ownness
and
self
appurtenance
of

is
still
very
remote
how

when
i
must
bind
myself
by

a

a

the
word
gesellschaft
society
has
its
origin
in
the
word
sal
hall
if
one
hall
encloses
many
persons
then
the
hall
causes
these
persons
to
be
in
society
they
are
in
society
and
at
most
constitute
a
parlour
society
by
talking
in
the
traditional
forms
of
parlour
speech
when
it
comes
to
real
intercourse
this
is
to
be
regarded
as
independent
of
society
it
may
occur
or
be
lacking
without
altering
the
nature
of
what
is
named
society
those
who
are
in
the
hall
are
a
society
even
as
mute
persons
or
when
they
put
each
other
off
solely
with
empty
phrases
of
courtesy
intercourse
is
mutuality
it
is
the
action
the
commercium
of
individuals
society
is
only
community
of
the
hall
and
even
the
statues
of
a
museum
hall
are
in
society
they
are
grouped
people
are
accustomed
to
say
they
haben
inne

this
hall
in
common
but
the
case
is
rather
that
the
hall
has
us
inne
or
in
it
so
far
the
natural
signification
of
the
word
society
in
this
it
comes
out
that
society
is
not
generated
by
me
and
you
but
by
a
third
factor
which
makes
associates
out
of
us
two
and
that
it
is
just
this
third
factor
that
is
the
creative
one
that
which
creates
society
just
so
a
prison
society
or
prison
companionship
those
who
enjoy
the
same
prison
here
we
already
hit
upon
a
third
factor
fuller
of
significance
than
was
that
merely
local
one
the
hall
prison
no
longer
means
a
space
only
but
a
space
with
express
reference
to
its
inhabitants
for
it
is
a
prison
only
through
being
destined
for
prisoners
without
whom
it
would
be
a
mere
building
what
gives
a
common
stamp
to
those
who
are
gathered
in
it
evidently
the
prison
since
it
is
only
by
means
of
the
prison
that
they
are
prisoners
what
then
determines
the
manner
of
life
of
the
prison
society
the
prison
what
determines
their
intercourse
the
prison
too
perhaps
certainly
they
can
enter
upon
intercourse
only
as
prisoners
only
so
far
as
the
prison
laws
allow
it
but
that
they
themselves
hold
intercourse
i
with
you
this
the
prison
cannot
bring
to
pass
on
the
contrary
it
must
have
an
eye
to
guarding
against
such
egoistic
purely
personal
intercourse
and
only
as
such
is
it
really
intercourse
between
me
and
you
that
we
jointly
execute
a
job
run
a
machine
effectuate
anything
in
general
q
for
this
a
prison
will
indeed
provide
but
that
i
forget
that
i
am
a
prisoner
and
engage
in
intercourse
with
you
who
likewise
disregard
it
brings
danger
to
the
prison
and
not
only
cannot
be
caused
by
it
but
must
not
even
be
permitted
for
this
reason
the
saintly
and
moral
minded
french
chamber
decides
to
introduce
solitary
confinement
and
other
saints
will
do
the
like
in
order
to
cut
off
demoralizing
intercourse
imprisonment
is
the
established
and
q
sacred
condition
to
injure
which
no
attempt
must
be
made
the
slightest
push
of
that
kind
is
punishable
as
is
every
uprising
against
a
sacred
thing
by
which
man
is
to
be
charmed
and
chained
like
the
hall
the
prison
does
form
a
society
a
companionship
a
communion
as
in
a
communion
of
labour
but
no
intercourse
no
reciprocity
no
union
on
the
contrary
every
union
in
the
prison
bears
within
it
the
dangerous
seed
of
a
plot
which
under
favourable
circumstances
might
spring
up
and
bear
fruit
yet
one
does
not
usually
enter
the
prison
voluntarily
and
seldom
remains
in
it
voluntarily
either
but
cherishes
the
egoistic
desire
for
liberty
here
therefore
it
sooner
becomes
manifest
that
personal
intercourse
is
in
hostile
relations
to
the
prison
society
and
tends
to
the
dissolution
of
this
very
society
this
joint
incarceration
let
us
therefore
look
about
for
such
communions
as
it
seems
we
remain
in
gladly
and
voluntarily
without
wanting
to
endanger
them
by
our
egoistic
impulses
as
a
communion
of
the
required
sort
the
family
offers
itself
in
the
first
place
parents
husbands
and
wife
children
brothers
and
sisters
represent
a
whole
or
form
a
family
for
the
further
widening
of
which
the
collateral
relatives
also
may
be
made
to
serve
if
taken
into
account
the
family
is
a
true
communion
only
when
the
law
of
the
family
piety
or
family
love
is
observed
by
its
members
a
son
to
whom
parents
brothers
and
sisters
have
become
indifferent
has
been
a
son
for
as
the
sonship
no
longer
shows
itself
efficacious
it
has
no
greater
significance
than
the
long
past
connection
of
mother
and
child
by
the
navel
string
that
one
has
once
lived
in
this
bodily
juncture
cannot
as
a
fact
be
undone
and
so
far
one
remains
irrevocably
this
mothers
son
and
the
brother
of
the
rest
of
her
children
but
it
would
come
to
a
lasting
connection
only
by
lasting
piety
this
spirit
of
the
family
individuals
are
members
of
a
family
in
the
full
sense
only
when
they
make
the
persistence
of
the
family
their
task
only
as
conservative
do
they
keep
aloof
from
doubting
their
basis
the
family
to
every
member
of
the
family
one
thing
must
be
fixed
and
sacred
q
to
wit
the
family
itself
or
more
expressively
piety
that
the
family
is
to
persist
remains
to
its
member
so
long
as
he
keeps
himself
free
from
that
egoism
which
is
hostile
to
the
family
an
unassailable
truth
in
a
word
q
if
the
family
is
sacred
then
nobody
who
belongs
to
it
may
secede
from
it
else
he
becomes
a
criminal
against
the
family
he
may
never
pursue
an
interest
hostile
to
the
family
form
a
misalliance
he
who
does
this
has
dishonoured
the
family
put
it
to
shame
etc
now
if
in
an
individual
the
egoistic
impulse
has
not
force
enough
he
complies
and
makes
a
marriage
which
suits
the
claims
of
the
family
takes
a
rank
which
harmonizes
with
its
position
and
the
like
in
short
he
does
honour
to
the
family
if
on
the
contrary
the
egoistic
blood
flows
fierily
enough
in
his
veins
he
prefers
to
become
a
criminal
against
the
family
and
to
throw
off
its
laws
which
of
the
two
lies
nearer
my
heart
the
good
of
the
family
or
my
good
in
innumerable
cases
both
go
peacefully
together
the
advantage
of
the
family
is
at
the
same
time
mine
and
vice
versa
then
it
is
hard
to
decide
whether
i
am
thinking
selfishly
or
for
the
common
benefit
and
perhaps
i
complacently
flatter
myself
with
my
unselfishness
but
there
comes
the
day
when
a
necessity
of
choice
makes
me
tremble
when
i
have
it
in
mind
to
dishonour
my
family
tree
to
affront
parents
brothers
and
kindred
what
then
now
it
will
appear
how
i
am
disposed
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
now
it
will
be
revealed
whether
piety
ever
stood
above
egoism
for
me
now
the
selfish
one
can
no
longer
skulk
behind
the
semblance
of
unselfishness
a
wish
rises
in
my
soul
and
growing
from
hour
to
hour
becomes
a
passion
to
whom
does
it
occur
at
first
blush
that
the
slightest
thought
which
may
result
adversely
to
the
spirit
of
the
family
piety
bears
within
it
a
transgression
against
this
nay
who
at
once
in
the
first
moment
becomes
completely
conscious
of
the
matter
it
happens
so
with
juliet
in
romeo
and
juliet
the
unruly
passion
can
at
last
no
longer
be
tamed
and
undermines
the
building
of
piety
you
will
say
indeed
it
is
from
self
will
that
the
family
casts
out
of
its
bosom
those
wilful
ones
that
grant
more
of
a
hearing
to
their
passion
than
to
piety
the
good
protestants
used
the
same
excuse
with
much
success
against
the
catholics
and
believed
in
it
themselves
but
it
is
just
a
subterfuge
to
roll
the
fault
off
oneself
nothing
more
the
catholics
had
regard
for
the
common
bond
of
the
church
and
thrust
those
heretics
from
them
only
because
these
did
not
have
so
much
regard
for
the
bond
of
the
church
as
to
sacrifice
their
convictions
to
it
the
former
therefore
held
the
bond
fast
because
the
bond
the
catholic
common
and
united
church
was
sacred
to
them
the
latter
on
the
contrary
disregarded
the
bond
just
so
those
who
lack
piety
they
are
not
thrust
out
but
thrust
themselves
out
prizing
their
passion
their
wilfulness
higher
than
the
bond
of
the
family
but
now
sometimes
a
wish
glimmers
in
a
less
passionate
and
wilful
heart
than
juliets
the
pliable
girl
brings
herself
as
a
sacrifice
to
the
peace
of
the
family
one
might
say
that
here
too
selfishness
prevailed
for
the
decision
came
from
the
feeling
that
the
pliable
girl
felt
herself
more
satisfied
by
the
unity
of
the
family
than
by
the
fulfilment
of
her
wish
that
might
be
but
what
if
there
remained
a
sure
sign
that
egoism
had
been
sacrificed
to
piety
what
if
even
after
the
wish
that
had
been
directed
against
the
peace
of
the
family
was
sacrificed
it
remained
at
least
as
a
recollection
of
a
sacrifice
brought
to
a
sacred
tie
what
if
the
pliable
girl
were
conscious
of
having
left
her
self
will
unsatisfied
and
humbly
subjected
herself
to
a
higher
power
subjected
and
sacrificed
because
the
superstition
of
piety
exercised
its
dominion
over
her
there
egoism
won
here
piety
wins
and
the
egoistic
heart
bleeds
there
egoism
was
strong
here
it
was
q
weak
but
the
weak
as
we
have
long
known
are
the
q
unselfish
for
them
for
these
its
weak
members
the
family
cares
because
they
belong
to
the
family
do
not
belong
to
themselves
and
care
for
themselves
this
weakness
hegel
praises
when
he
wants
to
have
match
making
left
to
the
choice
of
the
parents
as
a
sacred
communion
to
which
among
the
rest
the
individual
owes
obedience
the
family
has
the
judicial
function
too
vested
in
it
such
a
family
court
is
described
in
the
cabanis
of
wilibald
alexis

there
the
father
in
the
name
of
the
family
council
puts
the
intractable
son
among
the
soldiers
and
thrusts
him
out
of
the
family
in
order
to
cleanse
the
smirched
family
again
by
means
of
this
act
of
punishment
q
the
most
consist
ent
development
of
family
responsibility
is
contained
in
chinese
law
according
to
which
the
whole
family
has
to
expiate
the
individuals
fault
today
however
the
arm
of
family
power
seldom
reaches
far
enough
to
take
seriously
in
hand
the
punishment
of
apostates
in
most
cases
the
state
protects
even
against
disinheritance
the
criminal
against
the
family
family
criminal
flees
into
the
domain
of
the
state
and
is
free
as
the
state
criminal
who
gets
away
to
america
is
no
longer
reached
by
the
punishments
of
his
state
he
who
has
shamed
his
family
the
graceless
son
is
protected
against
the
familys
punishment
because
the
state
this
protecting
lord
takes
away
from
family
punishment
its
sacredness
and
profanes
it
decreeing
that
it
is
only
q
revenge
it
restrains
punishment
this
sacred
family
right
because
before
its
the
states
sacredness
the
subordinate
sacredness
of
the
family
always
pales
and
loses
its
sanctity
as
soon
as
it
comes
in
conflict
with
this
higher
sacredness
without
the
conflict
the
state
lets
pass
the
lesser
sacredness
of
the
family
but
in
the
opposite
case
it
even
commands
crime
against
the
family
charging
for
example
the
son
to
refuse
obedience
to
his
parents
as
soon
as
they
want
to
beguile
him
to
a
crime
against
the
state
well
the
egoist
has
broken
the
ties
of
the
family
and
found
in
the
state
a
lord
to
shelter
him
against
the
grievously
affronted
spirit
of
the
family
but
where
has
he
run
now
straight
into
a
new
society
in
which
his
egoism
is
awaited
by
the
same
snares
and
nets
that
it
has
just
escaped
for
the
state
is
likewise
a
society
not
a
union
it
is
the
broadened
family
father
of
the
country
q
mother
of
the
country
q
children
of
the
country
what
is
called
a
state
is
a
tissue
and
plexus
of
dependence
and
adherence
it
is
a
belonging
together
a
holding
together
in
which
those
who
are
placed
together
fit
themselves
to
each
other
or
in
short
mutually
depend
on
each
other
it
is
the
order
of
this
dependence
suppose
the
king
whose
authority
lends
authority
to
all
down
to
the
beadle
should
vanish
still
all
in
whom
the
will
for
order
was
awake
would
keep
order
erect
against
the
disorders
of
bestiality
if
disorder
were
victorious
the
state
would
be
at
an
end
but
is
this
thought
of
love
to
fit
ourselves
to
each
other
to
adhere
to
each
other
and
depend
on
each
other
really
capable
of
winning
us
according
to
this
the
state
should
be
love
realized
the
being
for
each
other
and
living
for
each
other
of
all
is
not
self
will
being
lost
while
we
attend
to
the
will
for
order
will
people
not
be
satisfied
when
order
is
cared
for
by
authority
when
authority
sees
to
it
that
no
one
gets
in
the
way
of
another
when
then
the
herd
is
judiciously
distributed
or
ordered
why
then
everything
is
in
the
best
order
and
it
is
this
best
order
that
is
called
q
state
our
societies
and
states
are
without
our
making
them
are
united
without
our
uniting
are
predestined
and
established
or
have
an
independent
standing
of
their
own
are
the
indissolubly
established
against
us
egoists
the
fight
of
the
world
today
is
as
it
is
said
directed
against
the
established
yet
people
are
wont
to
misunderstand
this
as
if
it
were
only
that
what
is
now
established
was
to
be
exchanged
for
another
a
better
established
system
but
war
might
rather
be
declared
against
establishment
itself
the
state
not
a
particular
state
not
any
such
thing
as
the
mere
condition
of
the
state
at
the
time
it
is
not
another
state
such
as
a
peoples
state
that
men
aim
at
but
their
union
uniting
this
ever
fluid
uniting
of
everything
standing
q
a
state
exists
even
without
my
co
operation
i
am
born
in
it
brought
up
in
it
under
obligations
to
it
and
must
do
it
homage

it
takes
me
up
into
its
favour

and
i
live
by
its
grace
thus
the
independent
establishment
of
the
state
founds
my
lack
of
independence
its
condition
as
a
natural
growth
its
organism
demands
that
my
nature
do
not
grow
freely
but
be
cut
to
fit
it
that
it
may
be
able
to
unfold
in
natural
growth
it
applies
to
me
the
shears
of
civilization
it
gives
me
an
education
and
culture
adapted
to
it
not
to
me
and
teaches
me
to
respect
the
laws
to
refrain
from
injury
to
state
property
that
is
private
property
to
reverence
divine
and
earthly
highness
etc
in
short
it
teaches
me
to
be
q
unpunishable
sacrificing
my
ownness
to
sacredness
everything
possible
is
sacred
property
others
life
etc
in
this
consists
the
sort
of
civilization
and
culture
that
the
state
is
able
to
give
me
it
brings
me
up
to
be
a
serviceable
instrument
a
serviceable
member
of
society
this
every
state
must
do
the
peoples
state
as
well
as
the
absolute
or
constitutional
one
it
must
do
so
as
long
as
we
rest
in
the
error
that
it
is
an
i
as
which
it
then
applies
to
itself
the
name
of
a
moral
mystical
or
political
person
i
who
really
am
i
must
pull
off
this
lion
skin
of
the
i
from
the
stalking
thistle
eater
what
manifold
robbery
have
i
not
put
up
with
in
the
history
of
the
world
there
i
let
sun
moon
and
stars
cats
and
crocodiles
receive
the
honour
of
ranking
as
i
there
jehovah
allah
and
our
father
came
and
were
invested
with
the
i
there
families
tribes
peoples
and
at
last
actually
mankind
came
and
were
honoured
as
is
there
the
church
the
state
came
with
the
pretension
to
be
i
q
and
i
gazed
calmly
on
all
what
wonder
if
then
there
was
always
a
real
i
too
that
joined
the
company
and
affirmed
in
my
face
that
it
was
not
my
you
but
my
real
i
why
the
son
of
man
par
excellence
had
done
the
like
why
should
not
a
son
of
man
do
it
too
so
i
saw
my
i
always
above
me
and
outside
me
and
could
never
really
come
to
myself
i
never
believed
in
myself
i
never
believed
in
my
present
i
saw
myself
only
in
the
future
the
boy
believes
he
will
be
a
proper
i
a
proper
fellow
only
when
he
has
become
a
man
the
man
thinks
only
in
the
other
world
will
he
be
something
proper
and
to
enter
more
closely
upon
reality
at
once
even
the
best
are
today
still
persuading
each
other
that
one
must
have
received
into
himself
the
state
his
people
mankind
and
what
not
in
order
to
be
a
real
i
a
free
burgher
a
citizen
a
free
or
true
man
they
too
see
the
truth
and
reality
of
me
in
the
reception
of
an
alien
i
and
devotion
to
it
and
what
sort
of
an
i
an
i
that
is
neither
an
i
nor
a
you
a
fancied
i
a
spook
while
in
the
middle
ages
the
church
could
well
brook
many
states
living
united
in
it
the
states
learned
after
the
reformation
especially
after
the
thirty
years
war
to
tolerate
many
churches
confessions
gathering
under
one
crown
but
all
states
are
religious
and
as
the
case
may
be
christian
states
and
make
it
their
task
to
force
the
intractable
the
egoists
under
the
bond
of
the
unnatural
that
is
christianize
them
all
arrangements
of
the
christian
state
have
the
object
of
christianizing
the
people
thus
the
court
has
the
object
of
forcing
people
to
justice
the
school
that
of
forcing
them
to
mental
culture
q
in
short
the
object
of
protecting
those
who
act
christianly
against
those
who
act
un
christianly
of
bringing
christian
action
to
dominion
of
making
it
powerful
among
these
means
of
force
the
state
counted
the
church
too
it
demanded
a
q
particular
religion
from
everybody
dupin
said
lately
against
the
clergy
instruction
and
education
belong
to
the
state
certainly
everything
that
regards
the
principle
of
morality
is
a
state
affair
hence
it
is
that
the
chinese
state
meddles
so
much
in
family
concerns
and
one
is
nothing
there
if
one
is
not
first
of
all
a
good
child
to
his
parents
family
concerns
are
altogether
state
concerns
with
us
too
only
that
our
state
q
puts
confidence
in
the
families
without
painful
oversight
it
holds
the
family
bound
by
the
marriage
tie
and
this
tie
cannot
be
broken
without
it
but
that
the
state
makes
me
responsible
for
my
principles
and
demands
certain
ones
from
me
might
make
me
ask
what
concern
has
it
with
the
wheel
in
my
head
principle
very
much
for
the
state
is
the
q
ruling
principle
it
is
supposed
that
in
divorce
matters
in
marriage
law
in
general
the
question
is
of
the
proportion
of
rights
between
church
and
states
rather
the
question
is
of
whether
anything
sacred
is
to
rule
over
man
be
it
called
faith
or
ethical
law
morality
the
state
behaves
as
the
same
ruler
that
the
church
was
the
latter
rests
on
godliness
the
former
on
morality
people
talk
of
the
tolerance
the
leaving
opposite
tendencies
free
and
the
like
by
which
civilized
states
are
distinguished
certainly
some
are
strong
enough
to
look
with
complacency
on
even
the
most
unrestrained
meetings
while
others
charge
their
catchpole
to
go
hunting
for
tobacco
pipes
yet
for
one
state
as
for
another
the
play
of
individuals
among
themselves
their
buzzing
to
and
fro
their
daily
life
is
an
incident
which
it
must
be
content
to
leave
to
themselves
because
it
can
do
nothing
with
this
many
indeed
still
strain
out
gnats
and
swallow
camels
while
others
are
shrewder
individuals
are
freer
in
the
latter
because
less
pestered
but
i
am
free
in
no
state
the
lauded
tolerance
of
states
is
simply
a
tolerating
of
the
harmless
the
not
dangerous
it
is
only
elevation
above
pettymindedness
only
a
more
estimable
grander
prouder
q
despotism
a
certain
state
seemed
for
a
while
to
mean
to
be
pretty
well
elevated
above
literary
combats
which
might
be
carried
on
with
all
heat
england
is
elevated
above
popular
turmoil
and
q
tobacco
smoking
but
woe
to
the
literature
that
deals
blows
at
the
state
itself
woe
to
the
mobs
that
endanger
the
state
in
that
certain
state
they
dream
of
a
free
science
in
england
of
a
free
popular
life
the
state
does
let
individuals
play
as
freely
as
possible
only
they
must
not
be
in
earnest
must
not
forget
it
man
must
not
carry
on
intercourse
with
man
unconcernedly
not
without
superior
oversight
and
mediation
i
must
not
execute
all
that
i
am
able
to
but
only
so
much
as
the
state
allows
i
must
not
turn
to
account
my
thoughts
nor
my
work
nor
in
general
anything
of
mine
the
state
always
has
the
sole
purpose
to
limit
tame
subordinate
the
individual
q
to
make
him
subject
to
some
generality
or
other
it
lasts
only
so
long
as
the
individual
is
not
all
in
all
and
it
is
only
the
clearly
marked
restriction
of
me
my
limitation
my
slavery
never
does
a
state
aim
to
bring
in
the
free
activity
of
individuals
but
always
that
which
is
bound
to
the
purpose
of
the
state
through
the
state
nothing
in
common
comes
to
pass
either
as
little
as
one
can
call
a
piece
of
cloth
the
common
work
of
all
the
individual
parts
of
a
machine
it
is
rather
the
work
of
the
whole
machine
as
a
unit
machine
work
in
the
same
style
everything
is
done
by
the
state
machine
too
for
it
moves
the
clockwork
of
the
individual
minds
none
of
which
follow
their
own
impulse
the
state
seeks
to
hinder
every
free
activity
by
its
censorship
its
supervision
its
police
and
holds
this
hindering
to
be
its
duty
because
it
is
in
truth
a
duty
of
self
preservation
the
state
wants
to
make
something
out
of
man
therefore
there
live
in
it
only
made
men
every
one
who
wants
to
be
his
own
self
is
its
opponent
and
is
nothing
he
is
nothing
means
as
much
as
the
state
does
not
make
use
of
him
grants
him
no
position
no
office
no
trade
and
the
like
edgar
bauer

in
the
liberalen
bestrebungen
vol
ii
p

is
still
dreaming
of
a
government
which
proceeding
out
of
the
people
can
never
stand
in
opposition
to
it
he
does
indeed
p

himself
take
back
the
word
government
in
the
republic
no
government
at
all
obtains
but
only
an
executive
authority
an
authority
which
proceeds
purely
and
alone
out
of
the
people
which
has
not
an
independent
power
independent
principles
independent
officers
over
against
the
people
but
which
has
its
foundation
the
fountain
of
its
power
and
of
its
principles
in
the
sole
supreme
authority
of
the
state
in
the
people
the
concept
government
therefore
is
not
at
all
suitable
in
the
peoples
state
but
the
thing
remains
the
same
that
which
has
proceeded
been
founded
sprung
from
the
fountain
becomes
something
independent
and
like
a
child
delivered
from
the
womb
enters
upon
opposition
at
once
the
government
if
it
were
nothing
independent
and
opposing
would
be
nothing
at
all
in
the
free
state
there
is
no
government
etc
p

this
surely
means
that
the
people
when
it
is
the
sovereign
does
not
let
itself
be
conducted
by
a
superior
authority
is
it
perchance
different
in
absolute
monarchy
is
there
there
for
the
sovereign
perchance
a
government
standing
over
him
over
the
sovereign
be
he
called
prince
or
people
there
never
stands
a
government
that
is
understood
of
itself
but
over
me
there
will
stand
a
government
in
every
state
in
the
absolute
as
well
as
in
the
republican
or
free
i
am
as
badly
off
in
one
as
in
the
other
the
republic
is
nothing
whatever
but
q
absolute
monarchy
for
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
monarch
is
called
prince
or
people
both
being
a
majesty
constitutionalism
itself
proves
that
nobody
is
able
and
willing
to
be
only
an
instrument
the
ministers
domineer
over
their
master
the
prince
the
deputies
over
their
master
the
people
here
then
the
parties
at
least
are
already
free
q
videlicet
the
office
holders
party
so
called
peoples
party
the
prince
must
conform
to
the
will
of
the
ministers
the
people
dance
to
the
pipe
of
the
chambers
constitutionalism
is
further
than
the
republic
because
it
is
the
state
in
incipient
dissolution
edgar
bauer
denies
p

that
the
people
is
a
personality
in
the
constitutional
state
per
contra
then
in
the
republic
well
in
the
constitutional
state
the
people
is
q
a
party
and
a
party
is
surely
a
personality
if
one
is
once
resolved
to
talk
of
a
political
p

moral
person
anyhow
the
fact
is
that
a
moral
person
be
it
called
peoples
party
or
people
or
even
the
lord
is
in
no
wise
a
person
but
a
spook
further
edgar
bauer
goes
on
p

guardianship
is
the
characteristic
of
a
government
truly
still
more
that
of
a
people
and
peoples
state
it
is
the
characteristic
of
all
dominion
a
peoples
state
which
unites
in
itself
all
completeness
of
power
the
absolute
master
cannot
let
me
become
powerful
and
what
a
chimera
to
be
no
longer
willing
to
call
the
peoples
officials
servants
instruments
because
they
execute
the
free
rational
law
will
of
the
people
p

he
thinks
p

only
by
all
official
circles
subordinating
themselves
to
the
governments
views
can
unity
be
brought
into
the
state
but
his
peoples
state
is
to
have
unity
too
how
will
a
lack
of
subordination
be
allowed
there
subordination
to
the
q
peoples
will
in
the
constitutional
state
it
is
the
regent
and
his
disposition
that
the
whole
structure
of
government
rests
on
in
the
end
p

how
would
that
be
otherwise
in
the
peoples
state
shall
i
not
there
be
governed
by
the
peoples
disposition
too
and
does
it
make
a
difference
for
me
whether
i
see
myself
kept
in
dependence
by
the
princes
disposition
or
by
the
peoples
disposition
so
called
public
opinion
if
dependence
means
as
much
as
religious
relation
as
edgar
bauer
rightly
alleges
then
in
the
peoples
state
the
people
remains
for
me
the
superior
power
the
majesty
for
god
and
prince
have
their
proper
essence
in
majesty
to
which
i
stand
in
religious
relations
q
like
the
sovereign
regent
the
sovereign
people
too
would
be
reached
by
no
law
edgar
bauers
whole
attempt
comes
to
a
change
of
masters
instead
of
wanting
to
make
the
people
free
he
should
have
had
his
mind
on
the
sole
realizable
freedom
his
own
in
the
constitutional
state
absolutism
itself
has
at
last
come
in
conflict
with
itself
as
it
has
been
shattered
into
a
duality
the
government
wants
to
be
absolute
and
the
people
wants
to
be
absolute
these
two
absolutes
will
wear
out
against
each
other
edgar
bauer
inveighs
against
the
determination
of
the
regent
by
birth
by
chance
but
when
the
people
have
become
the
sole
power
in
the
state
p

have
we
not
then
in
it
a
master
from
chance
why
what
is
the
people
the
people
has
always
been
only
the
body
of
the
government
it
is
many
under
one
hat
a
princes
hat
or
many
under
one
constitution
and
the
constitution
is
the
q
prince
princes
and
peoples
will
persist
so
long
as
both
do
not
collapse
that
is
fall
together
if
under
one
constitution
there
are
many
peoples
q
as
in
the
ancient
persian
monarchy
and
today
q
then
these
peoples
rank
only
as
provinces
for
me
the
people
is
in
any
case
an
q
accidental
power
a
force
of
nature
an
enemy
that
i
must
overcome
what
is
one
to
think
of
under
the
name
of
an
organized
people
p

a
people
that
no
longer
has
a
government
that
governs
itself
in
which
therefore
no
ego
stands
out
prominently
a
people
organized
by
ostracism
the
banishment
of
egos
ostracism
makes
the
people
autocrat
if
you
speak
of
the
people
you
must
speak
of
the
prince
for
the
people
if
it
is
to
be
a
subject
and
make
history

that

the
vox
populi
is
now
always
held
up
to
us
and
public
opinion
is
to
rule
our
princes
certainly
the
vox
populi
is
at
the
same
time
vox
dei
but
is
either
of
any
use
and
is
not
the
vox
principis
also
vox
dei
at
this
point
the
nationals
may
be
brought
to
mind
to
demand
of
the
thirty
eight
states
of
germany
that
they
shall
act
as
one
nation
can
only
be
put
alongside
the
senseless
desire
that
thirty
eight
swarms
of
bees
led
by
thirty
eight
queen
bees
shall
unite
themselves
into
one
swarm
bees
they
all
remain
but
it
is
not
the
bees
as
bees
that
belong
together
and
can
join
themselves
together
it
is
only
that
the
subject
bees
are
connected
with
the
ruling
queens
bees
and
peoples
are
destitute
of
will
and
the
instinct
of
their
queens
leads
them
if
one
were
to
point
the
bees
to
their
beehood
in
which
at
any
rate
they
are
all
equal
to
each
other
one
would
be
doing
the
same
thing
that
they
are
now
doing
so
stormily
in
pointing
the
germans
to
their
germanhood
why
germanhood
is
just
like
beehood
in
this
very
thing
that
it
bears
in
itself
the
necessity
of
cleavages
and
separations
yet
without
pushing
on
to
the
last
separation
where
with
the
complete
carrying
through
of
the
process
of
separating
its
end
appears
i
mean
to
the
separation
of
man
from
man
germanhood
does
indeed
divide
itself
into
different
peoples
and
tribes
beehives
but
the
individual
who
has
the
quality
of
being
a
german
is
still
as
powerless
as
the
isolated
bee
and
yet
only
individuals
can
enter
into
union
with
each
other
and
all
alliances
and
leagues
of
peoples
are
and
remain
mechanical
compoundings
because
those
who
come
together
at
least
so
far
as
the
peoples
are
regarded
as
the
ones
that
have
come
together
are
destitute
of
will
only
with
the
last
separation
does
separation
itself
end
and
change
to
unification
now
the
nationals
are
exerting
themselves
to
set
up
the
abstract
lifeless
unity
of
beehood
but
the
self
owned
are
going
to
fight
for
the
unity
willed
by
their
own
will
for
union
this
is
the
token
of
all
reactionary
wishes
that
they
want
to
set
up
something
general
abstract
an
empty
lifeless
concept
in
distinction
from
which
the
self
owned
aspire
to
relieve
the
robust
lively
particular
from
the
trashy
burden
of
generalities
the
reactionaries
would
be
glad
to
smite
a
people
a
nation
forth
from
the
earth
the
self
owned
have
before
their
eyes
only
themselves
in
essentials
the
two
efforts
that
are
just
now
the
order
of
the
day
to
wit
the
restoration
of
provincial
rights
and
of
the
old
tribal
divisions
franks
bavarians
lusatia

etc
and
the
restoration
of
the
entire
nationality
q
coincide
in
one
but
the
germans
will
come
into
unison
unite
themselves
only
when
they
knock
over
their
beehood
as
well
as
all
the
beehives
in
other
words
when
they
are
more
than
q
germans
only
then
can
they
form
a
german
union
they
must
not
want
to
turn
back
into
their
nationality
into
the
womb
in
order
to
be
born
again
but
let
every
one
turn
in
to
himself
how
ridiculously
sentimental
when
one
german
grasps
anothers
hand
and
presses
it
with
sacred
awe
because
he
too
is
a
german
with
that
he
is
something
great
but
this
will
certainly
still
be
thought
touching
as
long
as
people
are
enthusiastic
for
brotherliness
as
long
as
they
have
a
family
disposition
from
the
superstition
of
piety
from
brotherliness
or
childlikeness
or
however
else
the
soft
hearted
piety
phrases
run
q
from
the
family
spirit
q
the
nationals
who
want
to
have
a
great
family
of
germans
cannot
liberate
themselves
aside
from
this
the
so
called
nationals
would
only
have
to
understand
themselves
rightly
in
order
to
lift
themselves
out
of
their
juncture
with
the
good
natured
teutomaniacs
for
the
uniting
for
material
ends
and
interests
which
they
demand
of
the
germans
comes
to
nothing
else
than
a
voluntary
union
carri
re
inspired
cries
out

railroads
are
to
the
more
penetrating
eye
the
way
to
a
life
of
the
people
such
as
has
not
yet
anywhere
appeared
in
such
significance
quite
right
it
will
be
a
life
of
the
people
that
has
nowhere
appeared
because
it
is
not
a
q
life
of
the
people
q
so
carri
re
then
combats
himself
p

pure
humanity
or
manhood
cannot
be
better
represented
than
by
a
people
fulfilling
its
mission
why
by
this
nationality
only
is
represented
washed
out
generality
is
lower
than
the
form
complete
in
itself
which
is
itself
a
whole
and
lives
as
a
living
member
of
the
truly
general
the
organized
why
the
people
is
this
very
washed
out
generality
and
it
is
only
a
man
that
is
the
form
complete
in
itself
the
impersonality
of
what
they
call
people
nation
is
clear
also
from
this
that
a
people
which
wants
to
bring
its
i
into
view
to
the
best
of
its
power
puts
at
its
head
the
ruler
without
will
it
finds
itself
in
the
alternative
either
to
be
subjected
to
a
prince
who
realizes
only
himself
his
individual
pleasure
q
then
it
does
not
recognize
in
the
absolute
master
its
own
will
the
so
called
will
of
the
people
q
or
to
seat
on
the
throne
a
prince
who
gives
effect
to
no
will
of
his
own
q
then
it
has
a
prince
without
will
whose
place
some
ingenious
clockwork
would
perhaps
fill
just
as
well
q
therefore
insight
need
go
only
a
step
farther
then
it
becomes
clear
of
itself
that
the
i
of
the
people
is
an
impersonal
spiritual
power
the
q
law
the
peoples
i
therefore
is
a
q
spook
not
an
i
i
am
i
only
by
this
that
i
make
myself
that
it
is
not
another
who
makes
me
but
i
must
be
my
own
work
but
how
is
it
with
this
i
of
the
people
chance
plays
it
into
the
peoples
hand
chance
gives
it
this
or
that
born
lord
accidents
procure
it
the
chosen
one
he
is
not
its
the
sovereign
peoples
product
as
i
am
my
product
conceive
of
one
wanting
to
talk
you
into
believing
that
you
were
not
your
i
but
tom
or
jack
was
your
i
but
so
it
is
with
the
people
and
rightly
for
the
people
has
an
i
as
little
as
the
eleven
planets
counted
together
have
an
i
though
they
revolve
around
a
common
centre
baillys
utterance
is
representative
of
the
slave
disposition
that
folks
manifest
before
the
sovereign
people
as
before
the
prince
i
have
says
he
no
longer
any
extra
reason
when
the
general
reason
has
pronounced
itself
my
first
law
was
the
nations
will
as
soon
as
it
had
assembled
i
knew
nothing
beyond
its
sovereign
will
he
would
have
no
extra
reason
and
yet
this
extra
reason
alone
accomplishes
everything
just
so
mirabeau
inveighs
in
the
words
no
power
on
earth
has
the
right
to
say
to
the
nations
representatives
it
is
my
will
as
with
the
greeks
there
is
now
a
wish
to
make
man
a
zoon
politicon
a
citizen
of
the
state
or
political
man
so
he
ranked
for
a
long
time
as
a
citizen
of
heaven
but
the
greek
fell
into
ignominy
along
with
his
state
the
citizen
of
heaven
likewise
falls
with
heaven
we
on
the
other
hand
are
not
willing
to
go
down
along
with
the
people
the
nation
and
nationality
not
willing
to
be
merely
political
men
or
politicians
since
the
revolution
they
have
striven
to
make
the
people
happy
and
in
making
the
people
happy
great
and
the
like
they
make
us
unhappy
the
peoples
good
hap
is
q
my
mishap
what
empty
talk
the
political
liberals
utter
with
emphatic
decorum
is
well
seen
again
in
nauwercks
on
taking
part
in
the
state

there
complaint
is
made
of
those
who
are
indifferent
and
do
not
take
part
who
are
not
in
the
full
sense
citizens
and
the
author
speaks
as
if
one
could
not
be
man
at
all
if
one
were
not
a
politician
in
this
he
is
right
for
if
the
state
ranks
as
the
warder
of
everything
human
we
can
have
nothing
human
without
taking
part
in
it
but
what
does
this
make
out
against
the
egoist
nothing
at
all
because
the
egoist
is
to
himself
the
warder
of
the
human
and
has
nothing
to
say
to
the
state
except
get
out
of
my
sunshine
only
when
the
state
comes
in
contact
with
his
ownness
does
the
egoist
take
an
active
interest
in
it
if
the
condition
of
the
state
does
not
bear
hard
on
the
closet
philosopher
is
he
to
occupy
himself
with
it
because
it
is
his
most
sacred
duty
so
long
as
the
state
does
according
to
his
wish
what
need
has
he
to
look
up
from
his
studies
let
those
who
from
an
interest
of
their
own
want
to
have
conditions
otherwise
busy
themselves
with
them
not
now
nor
evermore
will
sacred
duty
bring
folks
to
reflect
about
the
state
q
as
little
as
they
become
disciples
of
science
artists
etc
from
sacred
duty
egoism
alone
can
impel
them
to
it
and
will
as
soon
as
things
have
become
much
worse
if
you
showed
folks
that
their
egoism
demanded
that
they
busy
themselves
with
state
affairs
you
would
not
have
to
call
on
them
long
if
on
the
other
hand
you
appeal
to
their
love
of
fatherland
and
the
like
you
will
long
preach
to
deaf
hearts
in
behalf
of
this
service
of
love
certainly
in
your
sense
the
egoists
will
not
participate
in
state
affairs
at
all
nauwerck
utters
a
genuine
liberal
phrase
on
p

man
completely
fulfils
his
calling
only
in
feeling
and
knowing
himself
as
a
member
of
humanity
and
being
active
as
such
the
individual
cannot
realize
the
idea
of
manhood
if
he
does
not
stay
himself
upon
all
humanity
if
he
does
not
draw
his
powers
from
it
like
antaeus
in
the
same
place
it
is
said
mans
relation
to
the
res
publica
is
degraded
to
a
purely
private
matter
by
the
theological
view
is
accordingly
made
away
with
by
denial
as
if
the
political
view
did
otherwise
with
religion
there
religion
is
a
private
matter
if
instead
of
sacred
duty
mans
destiny
the
calling
to
full
manhood
and
similar
commandments
it
were
held
up
to
people
that
their
self
interest
was
infringed
on
when
they
let
everything
in
the
state
go
as
it
goes
then
without
declamations
they
would
be
addressed
as
one
will
have
to
address
them
at
the
decisive
moment
if
he
wants
to
attain
his
end
instead
of
this
the
theology
hating
author
says
if
there
has
ever
been
a
time
when
the
state
laid
claim
to
all
that
are
hers
such
a
time
is
ours
q
the
thinking
man
sees
in
participation
in
the
theory
and
practice
of
the
state
a
duty
one
of
the
most
sacred
duties
that
rest
upon
him
q
and
then
takes
under
closer
consideration
the
unconditional
necessity
that
everybody
participate
in
the
state
he
in
whose
head
or
heart
or
both
the
state
is
seated
he
who
is
possessed
by
the
state
or
the
believer
in
the
state
is
a
politician
and
remains
such
to
all
eternity
the
state
is
the
most
necessary
means
for
the
complete
development
of
mankind
it
assuredly
has
been
so
as
long
as
we
wanted
to
develop
mankind
but
if
we
want
to
develop
ourselves
it
can
be
to
us
only
a
means
of
hindrance
can
state
and
people
still
be
reformed
and
bettered
now
as
little
as
the
nobility
the
clergy
the
church
etc
they
can
be
abrogated
annihilated
done
away
with
not
reformed
can
i
change
a
piece
of
nonsense
into
sense
by
reforming
it
or
must
i
drop
it
outright
henceforth
what
is
to
be
done
is
no
longer
about
the
state
the
form
of
the
state
etc
but
about
me
with
this
all
questions
about
the
princes
power
the
constitution
and
so
on
sink
into
their
true
abyss
and
their
true
nothingness
i
this
nothing
shall
put
forth
my
creations
from
myself

to
the
chapter
of
society
belongs
also
the
party
whose
praise
has
of
late
been
sung
in
the
state
the
party
is
current
party
party
who
should
not
join
one
but
the
individual
is
unique

not
a
member
of
the
party
he
unites
freely
and
separates
freely
again
the
party
is
nothing
but
a
state
in
the
state
and
in
this
smaller
bee
state
peace
is
also
to
rule
just
as
in
the
greater
the
very
people
who
cry
loudest
that
there
must
be
an
opposition
in
the
state
inveigh
against
every
discord
in
the
party
a
proof
that
they
too
want
only
a
q
state
all
parties
are
shattered
not
against
the
state
but
against
the
ego

one
hears
nothing
oftener
now
than
the
admonition
to
remain
true
to
his
party
party
men
despise
nothing
so
much
as
a
mugwump
one
must
run
with
his
party
through
thick
and
thin
and
unconditionally
approve
and
represent
its
chief
principles
it
does
not
indeed
go
quite
so
badly
here
as
with
closed
societies
because
these
bind
their
members
to
fixed
laws
or
statutes
such
as
the
orders
the
society
of
jesus
etc
but
yet
the
party
ceases
to
be
a
union
at
the
same
moment
at
which
it
makes
certain
principles
binding
and
wants
to
have
them
assured
against
attacks
but
this
moment
is
the
very
birth
act
of
the
party
as
party
it
is
already
a
born
society
a
dead
union
an
idea
that
has
become
fixed
as
party
of
absolutism
it
cannot
will
that
its
members
should
doubt
the
irrefragable
truth
of
this
principle
they
could
cherish
this
doubt
only
if
they
were
egoistic
enough
to
want
still
to
be
something
outside
their
party
non
partisans
non
partisans
they
cannot
be
as
party
men
but
only
as
egoists
if
you
are
a
protestant
and
belong
to
that
party
you
must
only
justify
protestantism
at
most
purge
it
not
reject
it
if
you
are
a
christian
and
belong
among
men
to
the
christian
party
you
cannot
be
beyond
this
as
a
member
of
this
party
but
only
when
your
egoism
non
partisanship
impels
you
to
it
what
exertions
the
christians
down
to
hegel
and
the
communists
have
put
forth
to
make
their
party
strong
they
stuck
to
it
that
christianity
must
contain
the
eternal
truth
and
that
one
needs
only
to
get
at
it
make
sure
of
it
and
justify
it
in
short
the
party
cannot
bear
non
partisanship
and
it
is
in
this
that
egoism
appears
what
matters
the
party
to
me
i
shall
find
enough
anyhow
who
unite
with
me
without
swearing
allegiance
to
my
flag
he
who
passes
over
from
one
party
to
another
is
at
once
abused
as
a
turncoat
certainly
morality
demands
that
one
stand
by
his
party
and
to
become
apostate
from
it
is
to
spot
oneself
with
the
stain
of
faithlessness
but
ownness
knows
no
commandment
of
faithlessness
adhesion
and
the
like
ownness
permits
everything
even
apostasy
defection
unconsciously
even
the
moral
themselves
let
themselves
be
led
by
this
principle
when
they
have
to
judge
one
who
passes
over
to
their
party
q
nay
they
are
likely
to
be
making
proselytes
they
should
only
at
the
same
time
acquire
a
consciousness
of
the
fact
that
one
must
commit
immoral
actions
in
order
to
commit
his
own
q
here
that
one
must
break
faith
yes
even
his
oath
in
order
to
determine
himself
instead
of
being
determined
by
moral
considerations
in
the
eyes
of
people
of
strict
moral
judgment
an
apostate
always
shimmers
in
equivocal
colours
and
will
not
easily
obtain
their
confidence
for
there
sticks
to
him
the
taint
of
faithlessness
of
an
immorality
in
the
lower
man
this
view
is
found
almost
generally
advanced
thinkers
fall
here
too
as
always
into
an
uncertainty
and
bewilderment
and
the
contradiction
necessarily
founded
in
the
principle
of
morality
does
not
on
account
of
the
confusion
of
their
concepts
come
clearly
to
their
consciousness
they
do
not
venture
to
call
the
apostate
immoral
downright
because
they
themselves
entice
to
apostasy
to
defection
from
one
religion
to
another
still
they
cannot
give
up
the
stand
point
of
morality
either
and
yet
here
the
occasion
was
to
be
seized
to
step
outside
of
morality
are
the
own
or
unique
perchance
a
party
how
could
they
be
own
if
they
were
such
as
belonged
to
a
party
or
is
one
to
hold
with
no
party
in
the
very
act
of
joining
them
and
entering
their
circle
one
forms
a
union
with
them
that
lasts
as
long
as
party
and
i
pursue
one
and
the
same
goal
but
today
i
still
share
the
partys
tendency
as
by
tomorrow
i
can
do
so
no
longer
and
i
become
untrue
to
it
the
party
has
nothing
binding
obligatory
for
me
and
i
do
not
have
respect
for
it
if
it
no
longer
pleases
me
i
become
its
foe
in
every
party
that
cares
for
itself
and
its
persistence
the
members
are
unfree
or
better
unown
in
that
degree
they
lack
egoism
in
that
degree
in
which
they
serve
this
desire
of
the
party
the
independence
of
the
party
conditions
the
lack
of
independence
in
the
party
members
a
party
of
whatever
kind
it
may
be
can
never
do
without
a
confession
of
faith
for
those
who
belong
to
the
party
must
believe
in
its
principle
it
must
not
be
brought
in
doubt
or
put
in
question
by
them
it
must
be
the
certain
indubitable
thing
for
the
party
member
that
is
one
must
belong
to
a
party
body
and
soul
else
one
is
not
truly
a
party
man
but
more
or
less
q
an
egoist
harbour
a
doubt
of
christianity
and
you
are
already
no
longer
a
true
christian
you
have
lifted
yourself
to
the
effrontery
of
putting
a
question
beyond
it
and
haling
christianity
before
your
egoistic
judgment
seat
you
have
q
sinned
against
christianity
this
party
cause
for
it
is
surely
not
for
example
a
cause
for
the
jews
another
party
but
well
for
you
if
you
do
not
let
yourself
be
affrighted
your
effrontery
helps
you
to
ownness
so
then
an
egoist
could
never
embrace
a
party
or
take
up
with
a
party
oh
yes
only
he
cannot
let
himself
be
embraced
and
taken
up
by
the
party
for
him
the
party
remains
all
the
time
nothing
but
a
gathering
he
is
one
of
the
party
he
takes
part

the
best
state
will
clearly
be
that
which
has
the
most
loyal
citizens
and
the
more
the
devoted
mind
for
legality
is
lost
so
much
the
more
will
the
state
this
system
of
morality
this
moral
life
itself
be
diminished
in
force
and
quality
with
the
good
citizens
the
good
state
too
perishes
and
dissolves
into
anarchy
and
lawlessness
respect
for
the
law
by
this
cement
the
total
of
the
state
is
held
together
the
law
is
sacred
and
he
who
affronts
it
a
criminal
without
crime
no
state
the
moral
world
q
and
this
the
state
is
q
is
crammed
full
of
scamps
cheats
liars
thieves
since
the
state
is
the
lordship
of
law
its
hierarchy
it
follows
that
the
egoist
in
all
cases
where
his
advantage
runs
against
the
states
can
satisfy
himself
only
by
crime
the
state
cannot
give
up
the
claim
that
its
laws
and
ordinances
are
sacred

at
this
the
individual
ranks
as
the
unholy
barbarian
natural
man
egoist
over
against
the
state
exactly
as
he
was
once
regarded
by
the
church
before
the
individual
the
state
takes
on
the
nimbus
of
a
saint

thus
it
issues
a
law
against
dueling
two
men
who
are
both
at
one
in
this
that
they
are
willing
to
stake
their
life
for
a
cause
no
matter
what
are
not
to
be
allowed
this
because
the
state
will
not
have
it
it
imposes
a
penalty
on
it
where
is
the
liberty
of
self
determination
then
it
is
at
once
quite
another
situation
if
as
in
north
america
society
determines
to
let
the
duelists
bear
certain
evil
consequences
of
their
act
such
as
withdrawal
of
the
credit
hitherto
enjoyed
to
refuse
credit
is
everybodys
affair
and
if
a
society
wants
to
withdraw
it
for
this
or
that
reason
the
man
who
is
hit
cannot
therefore
complain
of
encroachment
on
his
liberty
the
society
is
simply
availing
itself
of
its
own
liberty
that
is
no
penalty
for
sin
no
penalty
for
a
crime
the
duel
is
no
crime
there
but
only
an
act
against
which
the
society
adopts
counter
measures
resolves
on
a
defense
the
state
on
the
contrary
stamps
the
duel
as
a
crime
as
an
injury
to
its
sacred
law
it
makes
it
a
criminal
case
the
society
leaves
it
to
the
individuals
decision
whether
he
will
draw
upon
himself
evil
consequences
and
inconveniences
by
his
mode
of
action
and
hereby
recognizes
his
free
decision
the
state
behaves
in
exactly
the
reverse
way
denying
all
right
to
the
individuals
decision
and
instead
ascribing
the
sole
right
to
its
own
decision
the
law
of
the
state
so
that
he
who
transgresses
the
states
commandment
is
looked
upon
as
if
he
were
acting
against
gods
commandment
q
a
view
which
likewise
was
once
maintained
by
the
church
here
god
is
the
holy
in
and
of
himself
and
the
commandments
of
the
church
as
of
the
state
are
the
commandments
of
this
holy
one
which
he
transmits
to
the
world
through
his
anointed
and
lords
by
the
grace
of
god
if
the
church
had
deadly
sins
the
state
has
capital
crimes
if
the
one
had
heretics
the
other
has
traitors
the
one
ecclesiastical
penalties
the
other
criminal
penalties
the
one
inquisitorial
processes
the
other
fiscal
in
short
there
sins
here
crimes
there
inquisition
and
here
q
inquisition
will
the
sanctity
of
the
state
not
fall
like
the
churchs
the
awe
of
its
laws
the
reverence
for
its
highness
the
humility
of
its
subjects
will
this
remain
will
the
saints
face
not
be
stripped
of
its
adornment
what
a
folly
to
ask
of
the
states
authority
that
it
should
enter
into
an
honourable
fight
with
the
individual
and
as
they
express
themselves
in
the
matter
of
freedom
of
the
press
share
sun
and
wind
equally
if
the
state
this
thought
is
to
be
a
de
facto
power
it
simply
must
be
a
superior
power
against
the
individual
the
state
is
sacred
and
must
not
expose
itself
to
the
impudent
attacks
of
individuals
if
the
state
is
sacred
there
must
be
censorship
the
political
liberals
admit
the
former
and
dispute
the
inference
but
in
any
case
they
concede
repressive
measures
to
it
for
q
they
stick
to
this
that
state
is
more
than
the
individual
and
exercises
a
justified
revenge
called
punishment
punishment
has
a
meaning
only
when
it
is
to
afford
expiation
for
the
injuring
of
a
sacred
thing
if
something
is
sacred
to
any
one
he
certainly
deserves
punishment
when
he
acts
as
its
enemy
a
man
who
lets
a
mans
life
continue
in
existence
because
to
him
it
is
sacred
and
he
has
a
dread
of
touching
it
is
simply
a
q
religious
man
weitling
lays
crime
at
the
door
of
social
disorder
and
lives
in
the
expectation
that
under
communistic
arrangements
crimes
will
become
impossible
because
the
temptations
to
them
such
as
money
fall
away
as
however
his
organized
society
is
also
exalted
into
a
sacred
and
inviolable
one
he
miscalculates
in
that
good
hearted
opinion
such
as
with
their
mouth
professed
allegiance
to
the
communistic
society
but
worked
underhand
for
its
ruin
would
not
be
lacking
besides
weitling
has
to
keep
on
with
curative
means
against
the
natural
remainder
of
human
diseases
and
weaknesses
and
curative
means
always
announce
to
begin
with
that
individuals
will
be
looked
upon
as
called
to
a
particular
salvation
and
hence
treated
according
to
the
requirements
of
this
human
calling
curative
means
or
healing
is
only
the
reverse
side
of
punishment
the
theory
of
cure
runs
parallel
with
the
theory
of
punishment
if
the
latter
sees
in
an
action
a
sin
against
right
the
former
takes
it
for
a
sin
of
the
man
against
himself
as
a
decadence
from
his
health
but
the
correct
thing
is
that
i
regard
it
either
as
an
action
that
suits
me
or
as
one
that
does
not
suit
me
as
hostile
or
friendly
to
me
that
i
treat
it
as
my
property
which
i
cherish
or
demolish
crime
or
disease
are
not
either
of
them
an
egoistic
view
of
the
matter
a
judgment
starting
from
me
but
starting
from
another
q
to
wit
whether
it
injures
right
general
right
or
the
health
partly
of
the
individual
the
sick
one
partly
of
the
generality
society
crime
is
treated
inexorably
disease
with
loving
gentleness
compassion
and
the
like
punishment
follows
crime
if
crime
falls
because
the
sacred
vanishes
punishment
must
not
less
be
drawn
into
its
fall
for
it
too
has
significance
only
over
against
something
sacred
ecclesiastical
punishments
have
been
abolished
why
because
how
one
behaves
toward
the
holy
god
is
his
own
affair
but
as
this
one
punishment
ecclesiastical
punishment
has
fallen
so
all
punishments
must
fall
as
sin
against
the
so
called
god
is
a
mans
own
affair
so
is
that
against
every
kind
of
the
so
called
sacred
according
to
our
theories
of
penal
law
with
whose
improvement
in
conformity
to
the
times
people
are
tormenting
themselves
in
vain
they
want
to
punish
men
for
this
or
that
inhumanity
and
therein
they
make
the
silliness
of
these
theories
especially
plain
by
their
consistency
hanging
the
little
thieves
and
letting
the
big
ones
run
for
injury
to
property
they
have
the
house
of
correction
and
for
violence
to
thought
suppression
of
natural
rights
of
man
only
q
representations
and
petitions
the
criminal
code
has
continued
existence
only
through
the
sacred
and
perishes
of
itself
if
punishment
is
given
up
now
they
want
to
create
everywhere
a
new
penal
law
without
indulging
in
a
misgiving
about
punishment
itself
but
it
is
exactly
punishment
that
must
make
room
for
satisfaction
which
again
cannot
aim
at
satisfying
right
or
justice
but
at
procuring
us
a
satisfactory
outcome
if
one
does
to
us
what
we
will
not
put
up
with
we
break
his
power
and
bring
our
own
to
bear
we
satisfy
ourselves
on
him
and
do
not
fall
into
the
folly
of
wanting
to
satisfy
right
the
spook
it
is
not
the
sacred
that
is
to
defend
itself
against
man
but
man
against
man
as
god
too
you
know
no
longer
defends
himself
against
man
god
to
whom
formerly
and
in
part
indeed
even
now
all
the
servants
of
god
offered
their
hands
to
punish
the
blasphemer
as
they
still
at
this
very
day
lend
their
hands
to
the
sacred
this
devotion
to
the
sacred
brings
it
to
pass
also
that
without
lively
participation
of
ones
own
one
only
delivers
misdoers
into
the
hands
of
the
police
and
courts
a
non
participating
making
over
to
the
authorities
who
of
course
will
best
administer
sacred
matters
the
people
is
quite
crazy
for
hounding
the
police
on
against
everything
that
seems
to
it
to
be
immoral
often
only
unseemly
and
this
popular
rage
for
the
moral
protects
the
police
institution
more
than
the
government
could
in
any
way
protect
it
in
crime
the
egoist
has
hitherto
asserted
himself
and
mocked
at
the
sacred
the
break
with
the
sacred
or
rather
of
the
sacred
may
become
general
a
revolution
never
returns
but
a
mighty
reckless
shameless
conscienceless
proud
q
crime
does
it
not
rumble
in
distant
thunders
and
do
you
not
see
how
the
sky
grows
presciently
silent
and
gloomy

he
who
refuses
to
spend
his
powers
for
such
limited
societies
as
family
party
nation
is
still
always
longing
for
a
worthier
society
and
thinks
he
has
found
the
true
object
of
love
perhaps
in
human
society
or
mankind
to
sacrifice
himself
to
which
constitutes
his
honour
from
now
on
he
lives
for
and
serves
mankind
people
is
the
name
of
the
body
state
of
the
spirit
of
that
ruling
person
that
has
hitherto
suppressed
me
some
have
wanted
to
transfigure
peoples
and
states
by
broadening
them
out
to
mankind
and
general
reason
but
servitude
would
only
become
still
more
intense
with
this
widening
and
philantropists
and
humanitarians
are
as
absolute
masters
as
politicians
and
diplomats
modern
critics
inveigh
against
religion
because
it
sets
god
the
divine
moral
etc
outside
of
man
or
makes
them
something
objective
in
opposition
to
which
the
critics
rather
transfer
these
very
subjects
into
man
but
those
critics
none
the
less
fall
into
the
proper
error
of
religion
to
give
man
a
destiny
in
that
they
too
want
to
have
him
divine
human
and
the
like
morality
freedom
and
humanity
etc
are
his
essence
and
like
religion
politics
too
wanted
to
educate
man
to
bring
him
to
the
realization
of
his
essence
his
destiny
to
make
something
out
of
him
q
to
wit
a
true
man
the
one
in
the
form
of
the
true
believer
the
other
in
that
of
the
true
citizen
or
subject
in
fact
it
comes
to
the
same
whether
one
calls
the
destiny
the
divine
or
human
under
religion
and
politics
man
finds
himself
at
the
stand
point
of
should
he
should
become
this
and
that
should
be
so
and
so
with
this
postulate
this
commandment
every
one
steps
not
only
in
front
of
another
but
also
in
front
of
himself
those
critics
say
you
should
be
a
whole
free
man
thus
they
too
stand
in
the
temptation
to
proclaim
a
new
religion
to
set
up
a
new
absolute
an
ideal
q
to
wit
freedom
men
should
be
free
then
there
might
even
arise
missionaries
of
freedom
as
christianity
in
the
conviction
that
all
were
properly
destined
to
become
christians
sent
out
missionaries
of
the
faith
freedom
would
then
as
have
hitherto
faith
as
church
morality
as
state
constitute
itself
as
a
new
community
and
carry
on
a
like
propaganda
therefrom
certainly
no
objection
can
be
raised
against
a
getting
together
but
so
much
the
more
must
one
oppose
every
renewal
of
the
old
care
for
us
of
culture
directed
toward
an
end
q
in
short
the
principle
of
making
something
out
of
us
no
matter
whether
christians
subjects
or
freemen
and
men
one
may
well
say
with
feuerbach
and
others
that
religion
has
displaced
the
human
from
man
and
has
transferred
it
so
into
another
world
that
unattainable
it
went
on
with
its
own
existence
there
as
something
personal
in
itself
as
a
god
but
the
error
of
religion
is
by
no
means
exhausted
with
this
one
might
very
well
let
fall
the
personality
of
the
displaced
human
might
transform
god
into
the
divine
and
still
remain
religious
for
the
religious
consists
in
discontent
with
the
present
men
in
the
setting
up
of
a
perfection
to
be
striven
for
in
man
wrestling
for
his
completion

ye
therefore
should
be
perfect
as
your
father
in
heaven
is
perfect
matt


it
consists
in
the
fixation
of
an
ideal
an
absolute
perfection
is
the
supreme
good
the
finis
bonorum
every
ones
ideal
is
the
perfect
man
the
true
the
free
man
etc
the
efforts
of
modern
times
aim
to
set
up
the
ideal
of
the
free
man
if
one
could
find
it
there
would
be
a
new
q
religion
because
a
new
ideal
there
would
be
a
new
longing
a
new
torment
a
new
devotion
a
new
deity
a
new
contrition
with
the
ideal
of
absolute
liberty
the
same
turmoil
is
made
as
with
everything
absolute
and
according
to
hess
it
is
said
to
be
realizable
in
absolute
human
society

nay
this
realization
is
immediately
afterward
styled
a
vocation
just
so
he
then
defines
liberty
as
morality
the
kingdom
of
justice
equality
and
morality
liberty
is
to
begin
etc
ridiculous
is
he
who
while
fellows
of
his
tribe
family
nation
rank
high
is
q
nothing
but
puffed
up
over
the
merit
of
his
fellows
but
blinded
too
is
he
who
wants
only
to
be
man
neither
of
them
puts
his
worth
in
exclusiveness
but
in
connectedness
or
in
the
tie
that
conjoins
him
with
others
in
the
ties
of
blood
of
nationality
of
humanity
through
the
nationals
of
today
the
conflict
has
again
been
stirred
up
between
those
who
think
themselves
to
have
merely
human
blood
and
human
ties
of
blood
and
the
others
who
brag
of
their
special
blood
and
the
special
ties
of
blood
if
we
disregard
the
fact
that
pride
may
mean
conceit
and
take
it
for
consciousness
alone
there
is
found
to
be
a
vast
difference
between
pride
in
belonging
to
a
nation
and
therefore
being
its
property
and
that
in
calling
a
nationality
ones
property
nationality
is
my
quality
but
the
nation
my
owner
and
mistress
if
you
have
bodily
strength
you
can
apply
it
at
a
suitable
place
and
have
a
self
consciousness
or
pride
of
it
if
on
the
contrary
your
strong
body
has
you
then
it
pricks
you
everywhere
and
at
the
most
unsuitable
place
to
show
its
strength
you
can
give
nobody
your
hand
without
squeezing
his
the
perception
that
one
is
more
than
a
member
of
the
family
more
than
a
fellow
of
the
tribe
more
than
an
individual
of
the
people
has
finally
led
to
saying
one
is
more
than
all
this
because
one
is
man
or
the
man
is
more
than
the
jew
german
etc
therefore
be
every
one
wholly
and
solely
q
man
could
one
not
rather
say
because
we
are
more
than
what
has
been
stated
therefore
we
will
be
this
as
well
as
that
more
also
man
and
germans
then
man
and
guelph

the
nationals
are
in
the
right
one
cannot
deny
his
nationality
and
the
humanitarians
are
in
the
right
one
must
not
remain
in
the
narrowness
of
the
national
in
uniqueness

the
contradiction
is
solved
the
national
is
my
quality
but
i
am
not
swallowed
up
in
my
quality
q
as
the
human
too
is
my
quality
but
i
give
to
man
his
existence
first
through
my
uniqueness
history
seeks
for
man
but
he
is
i
you
we
sought
as
a
mysterious
essence
as
the
divine
first
as
god
then
as
man
humanity
humaneness
and
mankind
he
is
found
as
the
individual
the
finite
the
unique
one
i
am
owner
of
humanity
am
humanity
and
do
nothing
for
the
good
of
another
humanity
fool
you
who
are
a
unique
humanity
that
you
make
a
merit
of
wanting
to
live
for
another
than
you
are
the
hitherto
considered
relation
of
me
to
the
world
of
men
offers
such
a
wealth
of
phenomena
that
it
will
have
to
be
taken
up
again
and
again
on
other
occasions
but
here
where
it
was
only
to
have
its
chief
outlines
made
clear
to
the
eye
it
must
be
broken
off
to
make
place
for
an
apprehension
of
two
other
sides
toward
which
it
radiates
for
as
i
find
myself
in
relation
not
merely
to
men
so
far
as
they
present
in
themselves
the
concept
man
or
are
children
of
men
children
of
man
as
children
of
god
are
spoken
of
but
also
to
that
which
they
have
of
man
and
call
their
own
and
as
therefore
i
relate
myself
not
only
to
that
which
they
are
through
man
but
also
to
their
human
possessions
so
besides
the
world
of
men
the
world
of
the
senses
and
of
ideas
will
have
to
be
included
in
our
survey
and
somewhat
said
of
what
men
call
their
own
of
sensuous
goods
and
of
spiritual
as
well
according
as
one
had
developed
and
clearly
grasped
the
concept
of
man
he
gave
it
to
us
to
respect
as
this
or
that
person
of
respect
and
from
the
broadest
understanding
of
this
concept
there
proceeded
at
last
the
command
to
respect
man
in
every
one
but
if
i
respect
man
my
respect
must
likewise
extend
to
the
human
or
what
is
mans
men
have
somewhat
of
their
own
and
i
am
to
recognize
this
own
and
hold
it
sacred
their
own
consists
partly
in
outward
partly
in
inward
possessions
the
former
are
things
the
latter
spiritualities
thoughts
convictions
noble
feelings
but
i
am
always
to
respect
only
rightful
or
human
possessions
the
wrongful
and
unhuman
i
need
not
spare
for
only
mans
own
is
mens
real
own
an
inward
possession
of
this
sort
is
for
example
religion
because
religion
is
free
that
is
is
mans
i
must
not
strike
at
it
just
so
honour
is
an
inward
possession
it
is
free
and
must
not
be
struck
at
my
me
action
for
insult
caricatures
etc
religion
and
honour
are
spiritual
property
in
tangible
property
the
person
stands
foremost
my
person
is
my
first
property
hence
freedom
of
the
person
but
only
the
rightful
or
human
person
is
free
the
other
is
locked
up
your
life
is
your
property
but
it
is
sacred
for
men
only
if
it
is
not
that
of
an
inhuman
monster
what
a
man
as
such
cannot
defend
of
bodily
goods
we
may
take
from
him
this
is
the
meaning
of
competition
of
freedom
of
occupation
what
he
cannot
defend
of
spiritual
goods
falls
a
prey
to
us
likewise
so
far
goes
the
liberty
of
discussion
of
science
of
criticism
but
consecrated
goods
are
inviolable
consecrated
and
guarantied
by
whom
proximately
by
the
state
society
but
properly
by
man
or
the
concept
the
concept
of
the
thing
for
the
concept
of
consecrated
goods
is
this
that
they
are
truly
human
or
rather
that
the
holder
possesses
them
as
man
and
not
as
un
man

on
the
spiritual
side
mans
faith
is
such
goods
his
honour
his
moral
feeling
q
yes
his
feeling
of
decency
modesty
etc
actions
speeches
writings
that
touch
honour
are
punishable
attacks
on
the
foundations
of
all
religion
attacks
on
political
faith
in
short
attacks
on
everything
that
a
man
rightly
has
how
far
critical
liberalism
would
extend
the
sanctity
of
goods
q
on
this
point
it
has
not
yet
made
any
pronouncement
and
doubtless
fancies
itself
to
be
ill
disposed
toward
all
sanctity
but
as
it
combats
egoism
it
must
set
limits
to
it
and
must
not
let
the
un
man
pounce
on
the
human
to
its
theoretical
contempt
for
the
masses
there
must
correspond
a
practical
snub
if
it
should
get
into
power
what
extension
the
concept
man
receives
and
what
comes
to
the
individual
man
through
it
q
what
therefore
man
and
the
human
are
q
on
this
point
the
various
grades
of
liberalism
differ
and
the
political
the
social
the
humane
man
are
each
always
claiming
more
than
the
other
for
man
he
who
has
best
grasped
this
concept
knows
best
what
is
mans
the
state
still
grasps
this
concept
in
political
restriction
society
in
social
mankind
so
it
is
said
is
the
first
to
comprehend
it
entirely
or
the
history
of
mankind
develops
it
but
if
man
is
discovered
then
we
know
also
what
pertains
to
man
as
his
own
mans
property
the
human
but
let
the
individual
man
lay
claim
to
ever
so
many
rights
because
man
or
the
concept
man
entitles
him
to
them
because
his
being
man
does
it
what
do
i
care
for
his
right
and
his
claim
if
he
has
his
right
only
from
man
and
does
not
have
it
from
me
then
for
me
he
has
no
right
his
life
for
example
counts
to
me
only
for
what
it
is
worth
to
me
i
respect
neither
a
so
called
right
of
property
or
his
claim
to
tangible
goods
nor
yet
his
right
to
the
sanctuary
of
his
inner
nature
or
his
right
to
have
the
spiritual
goods
and
divinities
his
gods
remain
un
aggrieved
his
goods
the
sensuous
as
well
as
the
spiritual
are
mine
and
i
dispose
of
them
as
proprietor
in
the
measure
of
my
q
might
in
the
property
question
lies
a
broader
meaning
than
the
limited
statement
of
the
question
allows
to
be
brought
out
referred
solely
to
what
men
call
our
possessions
it
is
capable
of
no
solution
the
decision
is
to
be
found
in
him
from
whom
we
have
everything
property
depends
on
the
owner
the
revolution
directed
its
weapons
against
everything
which
came
from
the
grace
of
god
against
divine
right
in
whose
place
the
human
was
confirmed
to
that
which
is
granted
by
the
grace
of
god
there
is
opposed
that
which
is
derived
from
the
essence
of
man
now
as
mens
relation
to
each
other
in
opposition
to
the
religious
dogma
which
commands
a
love
one
another
for
gods
sake
had
to
receive
its
human
position
by
a
love
each
other
for
mans
sake
so
the
revolutionary
teaching
could
not
do
otherwise
than
first
as
to
what
concerns
the
relation
of
men
to
the
things
of
this
world
settle
it
that
the
world
which
hitherto
was
arranged
according
to
gods
ordinance
henceforth
belongs
to
man
the
world
belongs
to
man
and
is
to
be
respected
by
me
as
his
property
property
is
what
is
mine
property
in
the
civic
sense
means
sacred
property
such
that
i
must
respect
your
property
respect
for
property
hence
the
politicians
would
like
to
have
every
one
possess
his
little
bit
of
property
and
they
have
in
part
brought
about
an
incredible
parcellation
by
this
effort
each
must
have
his
bone
on
which
he
may
find
something
to
bite
the
position
of
affairs
is
different
in
the
egoistic
sense
i
do
not
step
shyly
back
from
your
property
but
look
upon
it
always
as
my
property
in
which
i
need
to
respect
nothing
pray
do
the
like
with
what
you
call
my
property
with
this
view
we
shall
most
easily
come
to
an
understanding
with
each
other
the
political
liberals
are
anxious
that
if
possible
all
servitudes
be
dissolved
and
every
one
be
free
lord
on
his
ground
even
if
this
ground
has
only
so
much
area
as
can
have
its
requirements
adequately
filled
by
the
manure
of
one
person
the
farmer
in
the
story
married
even
in
his
old
age
that
he
might
profit
by
his
wifes
dung
be
it
ever
so
little
if
one
only
has
somewhat
of
his
own
q
to
wit
a
respected
property
the
more
such
owners
such
cotters

the
more
free
people
and
good
patriots
has
the
state
political
liberalism
like
everything
religious
counts
on
respect
humaneness
the
virtues
of
love
therefore
does
it
live
in
incessant
vexation
for
in
practice
people
respect
nothing
and
every
day
the
small
possessions
are
bought
up
again
by
greater
proprietors
and
the
free
people
change
into
day
labourers
if
on
the
contrary
the
small
proprietors
had
reflected
that
the
great
property
was
also
theirs
they
would
not
have
respectfully
shut
themselves
out
from
it
and
would
not
have
been
shut
out
property
as
the
civic
liberals
understand
it
deserves
the
attacks
of
the
communists
and
proudhon
it
is
untenable
because
the
civic
proprietor
is
in
truth
nothing
but
a
property
less
man
one
who
is
everywhere
shut
out
instead
of
owning
the
world
as
he
might
he
does
not
own
even
the
paltry
point
on
which
he
turns
around
proudhon
wants
not
the
propritaire
but
the
possesseur
or
usufruitier

what
does
that
mean
he
wants
no
one
to
own
the
land
but
the
benefit
of
it
q
even
though
one
were
allowed
only
the
hundredth
part
of
this
benefit
this
fruit
q
is
at
any
rate
ones
property
which
he
can
dispose
of
at
will
he
who
has
only
the
benefit
of
a
field
is
assuredly
not
the
proprietor
of
it
still
less
he
who
as
proudhon
would
have
it
must
give
up
so
much
of
this
benefit
as
is
not
required
for
his
wants
but
he
is
the
proprietor
of
the
share
that
is
left
him
proudhon
therefore
denies
only
such
and
such
property
not
property
itself
if
we
want
no
longer
to
leave
the
land
to
the
landed
proprietors
but
to
appropriate
it
to
ourselves
we
unite
ourselves
to
this
end
form
a
union
a
societ
that
makes
itself
proprietor
if
we
have
good
luck
in
this
then
those
persons
cease
to
be
landed
proprietors
and
as
from
the
land
so
we
can
drive
them
out
of
many
another
property
yet
in
order
to
make
it
our
property
the
property
of
the
q
conquerors
the
conquerors
form
a
society
which
one
may
imagine
so
great
that
it
by
degrees
embraces
all
humanity
but
so
called
humanity
too
is
as
such
only
a
thought
spook
the
individuals
are
its
reality
and
these
individuals
as
a
collective
mass
will
treat
land
and
earth
not
less
arbitrarily
than
an
isolated
individual
or
so
called
propritaire
even
so
therefore
property
remains
standing
and
that
as
exclusive
too
in
that
humanity
this
great
society
excludes
the
individual
from
its
property
perhaps
only
leases
to
him
gives
his
as
a
fief
a
piece
of
it
as
it
besides
excludes
everything
that
is
not
humanity
does
not
allow
animals
to
have
property
so
too
it
will
remain
and
will
grow
to
be
that
in
which
all
want
to
have
a
share
will
be
withdrawn
from
that
individual
who
wants
to
have
it
for
himself
alone
it
is
made
a
common
estate
as
a
common
estate
every
one
has
his
share
in
it
and
this
share
is
his
property
why
so
in
our
old
relations
a
house
which
belongs
to
five
heirs
is
their
common
estate
but
the
fifth
part
of
the
revenue
is
each
ones
property
proudhon
might
spare
his
prolix
pathos
if
he
said
there
are
some
things
that
belong
only
to
a
few
and
to
which
we
others
will
from
now
on
lay
claim
or
q
siege
let
us
take
them
because
one
comes
to
property
by
taking
and
the
property
of
which
for
the
present
we
are
still
deprived
came
to
the
proprietors
likewise
only
by
taking
it
can
be
utilized
better
if
it
is
in
the
hands
of
us
all
than
if
the
few
control
it
let
us
therefore
associate
ourselves
for
the
purpose
of
this
robbery
vol
q
instead
of
this
he
tries
to
get
us
to
believe
that
society
is
the
original
possessor
and
the
sole
proprietor
of
imprescriptible
right
against
it
the
so
called
proprietors
have
become
thieves
la
propriete
cest
le
vol
if
it
now
deprives
of
his
property
the
present
proprietor
it
robs
him
of
nothing
as
it
is
only
availing
itself
of
its
imprescriptible
right
q
so
far
one
comes
with
the
spook
of
society
as
a
moral
person
on
the
contrary
what
man
can
obtain
belongs
to
him
the
world
belongs
to
me
do
you
say
anything
else
by
your
opposite
proposition
the
world
belongs
to
all
all
are
i
and
again
i
etc
but
you
make
out
of
the
all
a
spook
and
make
it
sacred
so
that
then
the
all
become
the
individuals
fearful
master
then
the
ghost
of
right
places
itself
on
their
side
proudhon
like
the
communists
fights
against
egoism
therefore
they
are
continuations
and
consistent
carryings
out
of
the
christian
principle
the
principle
of
love
of
sacrifice
for
something
general
something
alien
they
complete
in
property
only
what
has
long
been
extant
as
a
matter
of
fact
q
to
wit
the
propertylessness
of
the
individual
when
the
laws
says
ad
reges
potestas
omnium
pertinet
ad
singulos
proprietas
omnia
rex
imperio
possidet
singuli
dominio
this
means
the
king
is
proprietor
for
he
alone
can
control
and
dispose
of
everything
he
has
potesta
and
imperium
over
it
the
communists
make
this
clearer
transferring
that
imperium
to
the
society
of
all
therefore
because
enemies
of
egoism
they
are
on
that
account
q
christians
or
more
generally
speaking
religious
men
believers
in
ghosts
dependents
servants
of
some
generality
god
society
etc
in
this
too
proudhon
is
like
the
christians
that
he
ascribes
to
god
that
which
he
denies
to
men
he
names
him
on
page

the
proprietaire
of
the
earth
herewith
he
proves
that
he
cannot
think
away
the
proprietor
as
such
he
comes
to
a
proprietor
at
last
but
removes
him
to
the
other
world
neither
god
nor
man
human
society
is
proprietor
but
the
individual

proudhon
weitling
too
thinks
he
is
telling
the
worst
about
property
when
he
calls
it
theft
vol
passing
quite
over
the
embarrassing
question
what
well
founded
objection
could
be
made
against
theft
we
only
ask
is
the
concept
theft
at
all
possible
unless
one
allows
validity
to
the
concept
property
how
can
one
steal
if
property
is
not
already
extant
what
belongs
to
no
one
cannot
be
stolen
the
water
that
one
draws
out
of
the
sea
he
does
not
steal
accordingly
property
is
not
theft
but
a
theft
becomes
possible
only
through
property
weitling
has
to
come
to
this
too
as
he
does
regard
everything
as
the
property
of
all
if
something
is
the
property
of
all
then
indeed
the
individual
who
appropriates
it
to
himself
steals
private
property
lives
by
grace
of
the
law
only
in
the
law
has
it
its
warrant
q
for
possession
is
not
yet
property
it
becomes
mine
only
by
assent
of
the
law
it
is
not
a
fact
not
un
fait
as
proudhon
thinks
but
a
fiction
a
thought
this
is
legal
property
legitimate
property
guarantied
property
it
is
mine
not
through
me
but
through
the
q
law
nevertheless
property
is
the
expression
for
unlimited
dominion
over
somewhat
thing
beast
man
which
i
can
judge
and
dispose
of
as
seems
good
to
me
according
to
roman
law
indeed
jus
utendi
et
abutendi
re
sua
quatenus
juris
ratio
patitur
an
exclusive
and
unlimited
right
but
property
is
conditioned
by
might
what
i
have
in
my
power
that
is
my
own
so
long
as
i
assert
myself
as
holder
i
am
the
proprietor
of
the
thing
if
it
gets
away
from
me
again
no
matter
by
what
power
as
through
my
recognition
of
a
title
of
others
to
the
thing
q
then
the
property
is
extinct
thus
property
and
possession
coincide
it
is
not
a
right
lying
outside
my
might
that
legitimizes
me
but
solely
my
might
if
i
no
longer
have
this
the
thing
vanishes
away
from
me
when
the
romans
no
longer
had
any
might
against
the
germans
the
world
empire
of
rome
belonged
to
the
latter
and
it
would
sound
ridiculous
to
insist
that
the
romans
had
nevertheless
remained
properly
the
proprietors
whoever
knows
how
to
take
and
to
defend
the
thing
to
him
it
belongs
till
it
is
again
taken
from
him
as
liberty
belongs
to
him
who
takes
it
only
might
decides
about
property
and
as
the
state
no
matter
whether
state
or
well
to
do
citizens
or
of
ragamuffins
or
of
men
in
the
absolute
is
the
sole
mighty
one
it
alone
is
proprietor
i
the
unique

have
nothing
and
am
only
enfeoffed
am
vassal
and
as
such
servitor
under
the
dominion
of
the
state
there
is
no
property
of
mine
i
want
to
raise
the
value
of
myself
the
value
of
ownness
and
should
i
cheapen
property
no
as
i
was
not
respected
hitherto
because
people
mankind
and
a
thousand
other
generalities
were
put
higher
so
property
too
has
to
this
day
not
yet
been
recognized
in
its
full
value
property
too
was
only
the
property
of
a
ghost
the
peoples
property
my
whole
existence
belonged
to
the
fatherland
i
belonged
to
the
fatherland
the
people
the
state
and
therefore
also
everything
that
i
called
my
own
it
is
demanded
of
states
that
they
make
away
with
pauperism
it
seems
to
me
this
is
asking
that
the
state
should
cut
off
its
own
head
and
lay
it
at
its
feet
for
so
long
as
the
state
is
the
ego
the
individual
ego
must
remain
a
poor
devil
a
non
ego
the
state
has
an
interest
only
in
being
itself
rich
whether
michael
is
rich
and
peter
poor
is
alike
to
it
peter
might
also
be
rich
and
michael
poor
it
looks
on
indifferently
as
one
grows
poor
and
the
other
rich
unruffled
by
this
alternation
as
individuals
they
are
really
equal
before
its
face
in
this
it
is
just
before
it
both
of
them
are
q
nothing
as
we
are
altogether
sinners
before
god
on
the
other
hand
it
has
a
very
great
interest
in
this
that
those
individuals
who
make
it
their
ego
should
have
a
part
in
its
wealth
it
makes
them
partakers
in
its
property
through
property
with
which
it
rewards
the
individuals
it
tames
them
but
this
remains
its
property
and
every
one
has
the
usufruct
of
it
only
so
long
as
he
bears
in
himself
the
ego
of
the
state
or
is
a
loyal
member
of
society
in
the
opposite
case
the
property
is
confiscated
or
made
to
melt
away
by
vexatious
lawsuits
the
property
then
is
and
remains
state
property
not
property
of
the
ego
that
the
state
does
not
arbitrarily
deprive
the
individual
of
what
he
has
from
the
state
means
simply
that
the
state
does
not
rob
itself
he
who
is
state
ego
a
good
citizen
or
subject
holds
his
fief
undisturbed
as
such
an
ego
not
as
being
an
ego
of
his
own
according
to
the
code
property
is
what
i
call
mine
by
virtue
of
god
and
law
but
it
is
mine
by
virtue
of
god
and
law
only
so
long
as
q
the
state
has
nothing
against
it
in
expropriations
disarmaments
and
the
like
as
when
the
exchequer
confiscates
inheritances
if
the
heirs
do
not
put
in
an
appearance
early
enough
how
plainly
the
else
veiled
principle
that
only
the
people
the
state
is
proprietor
while
the
individual
is
feoffee
strikes
the
eye
the
state
i
mean
to
say
cannot
intend
that
anybody
should
for
his
own
sake
have
property
or
actually
be
rich
nay
even
well
to
do
it
can
acknowledge
nothing
yield
nothing
grant
nothing
to
me
as
me
the
state
cannot
check
pauperism
because
the
poverty
of
possession
is
a
poverty
of
me
he
who
is
nothing
but
what
chance
or
another
q
to
wit
the
state
makes
out
of
him
also
has
quite
rightly
nothing
but
what
another
gives
him
and
this
other
will
give
him
only
what
he
deserves
what
he
is
worth
by
service
it
is
not
he
that
realizes
a
value
from
himself
the
state
realizes
a
value
from
him
national
economy
busies
itself
much
with
this
subject
it
lies
far
out
beyond
the
national
however
and
goes
beyond
the
concepts
and
horizon
of
the
state
which
knows
only
state
property
and
can
distribute
nothing
else
for
this
reason
it
binds
the
possessions
of
property
to
conditions
q
as
it
binds
everything
to
them
as
in
marriage
allowing
validity
only
to
the
marriage
sanctioned
by
it
and
wresting
this
out
of
my
power
but
property
is
my
property
only
when
i
hold
it
unconditionally
only
i
an
unconditional
ego
have
property
enter
a
relation
of
love
carry
on
free
trade
the
state
has
no
anxiety
about
me
and
mine
but
about
itself
and
its
i
count
for
something
to
it
only
as
its
child
as
a
son
of
the
country
as
ego
i
am
nothing
at
all
for
it
for
the
states
understanding
what
befalls
me
as
ego
is
something
accidental
my
wealth
as
well
as
my
impoverishment
but
if
i
with
all
that
is
mine
am
an
accident
in
the
states
eyes
this
proves
that
it
cannot
comprehend
me
i
go
beyond
its
concepts
or
its
understanding
is
too
limited
to
comprehend
me
therefore
it
cannot
do
anything
for
me
either
pauperism
is
the
valuelessness
of
me
the
phenomenon
that
i
cannot
realize
value
from
myself
for
this
reason
state
and
pauperism
are
one
and
the
same
the
state
does
not
let
me
come
to
my
value
and
continues
in
existence
only
through
my
valuelessness
it
is
forever
intent
on
getting
benefit
from
me
exploiting
me
turning
me
to
account
using
me
up
even
if
the
use
it
gets
from
me
consists
only
in
my
supplying
a
proles
proletariat
it
wants
me
to
be
its
creature
pauperism
can
be
removed
only
when
i
as
ego
realize
value
from
myself
when
i
give
my
own
self
value
and
make
my
price
myself
i
must
rise
in
revolt
to
rise
in
the
world
what
i
produce
flour
linen
or
iron
and
coal
which
i
toilsomely
win
from
the
earth
is
my
work
that
i
want
to
realize
value
from
but
then
i
may
long
complain
that
i
am
not
paid
for
my
work
according
to
its
value
the
payer
will
not
listen
to
me
and
the
state
likewise
will
maintain
an
apathetic
attitude
so
long
as
it
does
not
think
it
must
appease
me
that
i
may
not
break
out
with
my
dreaded
might
but
this
appeasing
will
be
all
and
if
it
comes
into
my
head
to
ask
for
more
the
state
turns
against
me
with
all
the
force
of
its
lion
paws
and
eagle
claws
for
it
is
the
king
of
beasts
it
is
lion
and
eagle
if
i
refuse
to
be
content
with
the
price
that
it
fixes
for
my
ware
and
labour
if
i
rather
aspire
to
determine
the
price
of
my
ware
myself
that
is
to
pay
myself
in
the
first
place
i
come
into
a
conflict
with
the
buyers
of
the
ware
if
this
were
stilled
by
a
mutual
understanding
the
state
would
not
readily
make
objections
for
how
individuals
get
along
with
each
other
troubles
it
little
so
long
as
therein
they
do
not
get
in
its
way
its
damage
and
its
danger
begin
only
when
they
do
not
agree
but
in
the
absence
of
a
settlement
take
each
other
by
the
hair
the
state
cannot
endure
that
man
stand
in
a
direct
relation
to
man
it
must
step
between
as
mediator
must
intervene
what
christ
was
what
the
saints
the
church
were
the
state
has
become
to
wit
mediator
it
tears
man
from
man
to
put
itself
between
them
as
spirit
the
labourers
who
ask
for
higher
pay
are
treated
as
criminals
as
soon
as
they
want
to
compel
it
what
are
they
to
do
without
compulsion
they
dont
get
it
and
in
compulsion
the
state
sees
a
self
help
a
determination
of
price
by
the
ego
a
genuine
free
realization
of
value
from
his
property
which
it
cannot
admit
of
what
then
are
the
labourers
to
do
look
to
themselves
and
ask
nothing
about
the
state
q
q
but
as
is
the
situation
with
regard
to
my
material
work
so
it
is
with
my
intellectual
too
the
state
allows
me
to
realize
value
from
all
my
thoughts
and
to
find
customers
for
them
i
do
realize
value
from
them
in
the
very
fact
that
they
bring
me
honour
from
the
listeners
and
the
like
but
only
so
long
as
my
thoughts
are
its
thoughts
if
on
the
other
hand
i
harbour
thoughts
that
it
cannot
approve
make
its
own
then
it
does
not
allow
me
at
all
to
realize
value
from
them
to
bring
them
into
exchange
into
commerce
my
thoughts
are
free
only
if
they
are
granted
to
me
by
the
states
grace
if
they
are
the
states
thoughts
it
lets
me
philosophize
freely
only
so
far
as
i
approve
myself
a
philosopher
of
state
against
the
state
i
must
not
philosophize
gladly
as
it
tolerates
my
helping
it
out
of
its
deficiencies
furthering
it
q
therefore
as
i
may
behave
only
as
an
ego
most
graciously
permitted
by
the
state
provided
with
its
testimonial
of
legitimacy
and
police
pass
so
too
it
is
not
granted
me
to
realize
value
from
what
is
mine
unless
this
proves
to
be
its
which
i
hold
as
fief
from
it
my
ways
must
be
its
ways
else
it
distrains
me
my
thoughts
its
thoughts
else
it
stops
my
mouth
the
state
has
nothing
to
be
more
afraid
of
than
the
value
of
me
and
nothing
must
it
more
carefully
guard
against
than
every
occasion
that
offers
itself
to
me
for
realizing
value
from
myself
i
am
the
deadly
enemy
of
the
state
which
always
hovers
between
the
alternatives
it
or
i
therefore
it
strictly
insists
not
only
on
not
letting
me
have
a
standing
but
also
on
keeping
down
what
is
mine
in
the
state
there
is
no
property
no
property
of
the
individual
but
only
state
property
only
through
the
state
have
i
what
i
have
as
i
am
only
through
it
what
i
am
my
private
property
is
only
that
which
the
state
leaves
to
me
of
its
cutting
off
others
from
it
depriving
them
making
it
private
it
is
state
property
but
in
opposition
to
the
state
i
feel
more
and
more
clearly
that
there
is
still
left
me
a
great
might
the
might
over
myself
over
everything
that
pertains
only
to
me
and
that
exists
only
in
being
my
own
what
do
i
do
if
my
ways
are
no
longer
its
ways
my
thoughts
no
longer
its
thoughts
i
look
to
myself
and
ask
nothing
about
it
in
my
thoughts
which
i
get
sanctioned
by
no
assent
grant
or
grace
i
have
my
real
property
a
property
with
which
i
can
trade
for
as
mine
they
are
my
creatures
and
i
am
in
a
position
to
give
them
away
in
return
for
other
thoughts
i
give
them
up
and
take
in
exchange
for
them
others
which
then
are
my
new
purchased
property
what
then
is
my
property
nothing
but
what
is
in
my
power
to
what
property
am
i
entitled
to
every
property
to
which
i
q
empower
myself

i
give
myself
the
right
of
property
in
taking
property
to
myself
or
giving
myself
the
proprietors
power
full
power
empowerment
everything
over
which
i
have
might
that
cannot
be
torn
from
me
remains
my
property
well
then
let
might
decide
about
property
and
i
will
expect
everything
from
my
might
alien
might
might
that
i
leave
to
another
makes
me
an
owned
slave
then
let
my
own
might
make
me
an
owner
let
me
then
withdraw
the
might
that
i
have
conceded
to
others
out
of
ignorance
regarding
the
strength
of
my
own
might
let
me
say
to
myself
what
my
might
reaches
to
is
my
property
and
let
me
claim
as
property
everything
that
i
feel
myself
strong
enough
to
attain
and
let
me
extend
my
actual
property
as
far
as
i
entitle
that
is
empower
myself
to
take
here
egoism
selfishness
must
decide
not
the
principle
of
love
not
love
motives
like
mercy
gentleness
good
nature
or
even
justice
and
equity
for
justitia
too
is
a
phenomenon
of
q
love
a
product
of
love
love
knows
only
sacrifices
and
demands
self
sacrifice
egoism
does
not
think
of
sacrificing
anything
giving
away
anything
that
it
wants
it
simply
decides
what
i
want
i
must
have
and
will
procure
all
attempts
to
enact
rational
laws
about
property
have
put
out
from
the
bay
of
love
into
a
desolate
sea
of
regulations
even
socialism
and
communism
cannot
be
excepted
from
this
every
one
is
to
be
provided
with
adequate
means
for
which
it
is
little
to
the
point
whether
one
socialistically
finds
them
still
in
a
personal
property
or
communistically
draws
them
from
the
community
of
goods
the
individuals
mind
in
this
remains
the
same
it
remains
a
mind
of
dependence
the
distributing
board
of
equity
lets
me
have
only
what
the
sense
of
equity
its
loving
care
for
all
prescribes
for
me
the
individual
there
lies
no
less
of
a
check
in
collective
wealth
than
in
that
of
individual
others
neither
that
is
mine
nor
this
whether
the
wealth
belongs
to
the
collectivity
which
confers
part
of
it
on
me
or
to
individual
possessors
is
for
me
the
same
constraint
as
i
cannot
decide
about
either
of
the
two
on
the
contrary
communism
by
the
abolition
of
all
personal
property
only
presses
me
back
still
more
into
dependence
on
another
to
wit
on
the
generality
or
collectivity
and
loudly
as
it
always
attacks
the
state
what
it
intends
is
itself
again
a
state
a
status
a
condition
hindering
my
free
movement
a
sovereign
power
over
me
communism
rightly
revolts
against
the
pressure
that
i
experience
from
individual
proprietors
but
still
more
horrible
is
the
might
that
it
puts
in
the
hands
of
the
collectivity
egoism
takes
another
way
to
root
out
the
non
possessing
rabble
it
does
not
say
wait
for
what
the
board
of
equity
will
q
bestow
on
you
in
the
name
of
the
collectivity
for
such
bestowal
took
place
in
states
from
the
most
ancient
times
each
receiving
according
to
his
desert
and
therefore
according
to
the
measure
in
which
each
was
able
to
deserve
it
to
acquire
it
by
service
but
take
hold
and
take
what
you
require
with
this
the
war
of
all
against
all
is
declared
i
alone
decide
what
i
will
have
now
that
is
truly
no
new
wisdom
for
self
seekers
have
acted
so
at
all
times
not
at
all
necessary
either
that
the
thing
be
new
if
only
consciousness
of
it
is
present
but
this
latter
will
not
be
able
to
claim
great
age
unless
perhaps
one
counts
in
the
egyptian
and
spartan
law
for
how
little
current
it
is
appears
even
from
the
stricture
above
which
speaks
with
contempt
of
self
seekers
one
is
to
know
just
this
that
the
procedure
of
taking
hold
is
not
contemptible
but
manifests
the
pure
deed
of
the
egoist
at
one
with
himself
only
when
i
expect
neither
from
individuals
nor
from
a
collectivity
what
i
can
give
to
myself
only
then
do
i
slip
out
of
the
snares
of
q
love
the
rabble
ceases
to
be
rabble
only
when
it
takes
hold
only
the
dread
of
taking
hold
and
the
corresponding
punishment
thereof
makes
it
a
rabble
only
that
taking
hold
is
sin
crime
q
only
this
dogma
creates
a
rabble
for
the
fact
that
the
rabble
remains
what
it
is
it
because
it
allows
validity
to
that
dogma
is
to
blame
as
well
as
more
especially
those
who
self
seekingly
to
give
them
back
their
favourite
word
demand
that
the
dogma
be
respected
in
short
the
lack
of
consciousness
of
that
new
wisdom
the
old
consciousness
of
sin
alone
bears
the
blame
if
men
reach
the
point
of
losing
respect
for
property
every
one
will
have
property
as
all
slaves
become
free
men
as
soon
as
they
no
longer
respect
the
master
as
master
unions
will
then
in
this
matter
too
multiply
the
individuals
means
and
secure
his
assailed
property
according
to
the
communists
opinion
the
commune
should
be
proprietor
on
the
contrary
i
am
proprietor
and
i
only
come
to
an
understanding
with
others
about
my
property
if
the
commune
does
not
do
what
suits
me
i
rise
against
it
and
defend
my
property
i
am
proprietor
but
property
is
not
sacred
i
should
be
merely
possessor
no
hitherto
one
was
only
possessor
secured
in
the
possession
of
a
parcel
by
leaving
others
also
in
possession
of
a
parcel
but
now
everything
belongs
to
me
i
am
proprietor
of
everything
that
i
require
and
can
get
possession
of
if
it
is
said
socialistically
society
gives
me
what
i
require
then
the
egoist
says
i
take
what
i
require
if
the
communists
conduct
themselves
as
ragamuffins
the
egoist
behaves
as
proprietor
all
swan
fraternities

and
attempts
at
making
the
rabble
happy
that
spring
from
the
principle
of
love
must
miscarry
only
from
egoism
can
the
rabble
get
help
and
this
help
it
must
give
to
itself
and
q
will
give
to
itself
if
it
does
not
let
itself
be
coerced
into
fear
it
is
a
power
people
would
lose
all
respect
if
one
did
not
coerce
them
into
fear
says
bugbear
law
in
der
gestiefelte
kater

property
therefore
should
not
and
cannot
be
abolished
it
must
rather
be
torn
from
ghostly
hands
and
become
my
property
then
the
erroneous
consciousness
that
i
cannot
entitle
myself
to
as
much
as
i
require
will
vanish
q
but
what
cannot
man
require
well
whoever
requires
much
and
understands
how
to
get
it
has
at
all
times
helped
himself
to
it
as
napoleon
did
with
the
continent
and
france
with
algiers

hence
the
exact
point
is
that
the
respectful
rabble
should
learn
at
last
to
help
itself
to
what
it
requires
if
it
reaches
out
too
far
for
you
why
then
defend
yourselves
you
have
no
need
at
all
to
good
heartedly
q
bestow
anything
on
it
and
when
it
learns
to
know
itself
it
q
or
rather
whoever
of
the
rabble
learns
to
know
himself
he
casts
off
the
rabble
quality
in
refusing
your
alms
with
thanks
but
it
remains
ridiculous
that
you
declare
the
rabble
sinful
and
criminal
if
it
is
not
pleased
to
live
from
your
favours
because
it
can
do
something
in
its
own
favour
your
bestowals
cheat
it
and
put
it
off
defend
your
property
then
you
will
be
strong
if
on
the
other
hand
you
want
to
retain
your
ability
to
bestow
and
perhaps
actually
have
the
more
political
rights
the
more
alms
poor
rates
you
can
give
this
will
work
just
as
long
as
the
recipients
let
you
work
it

in
short
the
property
question
cannot
be
solved
so
amicably
as
the
socialists
yes
even
the
communists
dream
it
is
solved
only
by
the
war
of
all
against
all
the
poor
become
free
and
proprietors
only
when
they
q
rise
bestow
ever
so
much
on
them
they
will
still
always
want
more
for
they
want
nothing
less
than
that
at
last
q
nothing
more
be
bestowed
it
will
be
asked
but
how
then
will
it
be
when
the
have
nots
take
heart
of
what
sort
is
the
settlement
to
be
one
might
as
well
ask
that
i
cast
a
childs
nativity
what
a
slave
will
do
as
soon
as
he
has
broken
his
fetters
one
must
q
await
in
kaisers
pamphlet

worthless
for
lack
of
form
as
well
as
substance
he
hopes
from
the
state
that
it
will
bring
about
a
leveling
of
property
always
the
state
herr
papa
as
the
church
was
proclaimed
and
looked
upon
as
the
mother
of
believers
so
the
state
has
altogether
the
face
of
the
provident
father

competition
shows
itself
most
strictly
connected
with
the
principle
of
civism
is
it
anything
else
than
equality
galit
and
is
not
equality
a
product
of
that
same
revolution
which
was
brought
on
by
the
commonalty
the
middle
classes
as
no
one
is
barred
from
competing
with
all
in
the
state
except
the
prince
because
he
represents
the
state
itself
and
working
himself
up
to
their
height
yes
overthrowing
or
exploiting
them
for
his
own
advantage
soaring
above
them
and
by
stronger
exertion
depriving
them
of
their
favourable
circumstances
q
this
serves
as
a
clear
proof
that
before
the
states
judgment
seat
every
one
has
only
the
value
of
a
simple
individual
and
may
not
count
on
any
favouritism
outrun
and
outbid
each
other
as
much
as
you
like
and
can
that
shall
not
trouble
me
the
state
among
yourselves
you
are
free
in
competing
you
are
competitors
that
is
your
social
position
but
before
me
the
state
you
are
nothing
but
simple
individuals

what
in
the
form
of
principle
or
theory
was
propounded
as
the
equality
of
all
has
found
here
in
competition
its
realization
and
practical
carrying
out
for
galit
is
q
free
competition
all
are
before
the
state
q
simple
individuals
in
society
or
in
relation
to
each
other
q
competitors
i
need
be
nothing
further
than
a
simple
individual
to
be
able
to
compete
with
all
others
aside
from
the
prince
and
his
family
a
freedom
which
formerly
was
made
impossible
by
the
fact
that
only
by
means
of
ones
corporation
and
within
it
did
one
enjoy
any
freedom
of
effort
in
the
guild
and
feudality
the
state
is
in
an
intolerant
and
fastidious
attitude
granting
privileges
in
competition
and
liberalism
it
is
in
a
tolerant
and
indulgent
attitude
granting
only
patents
letters
assuring
the
applicant
that
the
business
stands
open
patent
to
him
or
concessions
now
as
the
state
has
thus
left
everything
to
the
applicants
it
must
come
in
conflict
with
all
because
each
and
all
are
entitled
to
make
application
it
will
be
stormed
and
will
go
down
in
this
storm
is
free
competition
then
really
free
nay
is
it
really
a
competition
q
to
wit
one
of
persons
q
as
it
gives
itself
out
to
be
because
on
this
title
it
bases
its
right
it
originated
you
know
in
persons
becoming
free
of
all
personal
rule
is
a
competition
free
which
the
state
this
ruler
in
the
civic
principle
hems
in
by
a
thousand
barriers
there
is
a
rich
manufacturer
doing
a
brilliant
business
and
i
should
like
to
compete
with
him
go
ahead
says
the
state
i
have
no
objection
to
make
to
your
person
as
competitor
yes
i
reply
but
for
that
i
need
a
space
for
buildings
i
need
money
thats
bad
but
if
you
have
no
money
you
cannot
compete
you
must
not
take
anything
from
anybody
for
i
protect
property
and
grant
it
privileges
free
competition
is
not
free
because
i
lack
the
things
for
competition
against
my
person
no
objection
can
be
made
but
because
i
have
not
the
things
my
person
too
must
step
to
the
rear
and
who
has
the
necessary
things
perhaps
that
manufacturer
why
from
him
i
could
take
them
away
no
the
state
has
them
as
property
the
manufacturer
only
as
fief
as
possession
but
since
it
is
no
use
trying
it
with
the
manufacturer
i
will
compete
with
that
professor
of
jurisprudence
the
man
is
a
booby
and
i
who
know
a
hundred
times
more
than
he
shall
make
his
class
room
empty
have
you
studied
and
graduated
friend
no
but
what
of
that
i
understand
abundantly
what
is
necessary
for
instruction
in
that
department
sorry
but
competition
is
not
free
here
against
your
person
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
but
the
thing
the
doctors
diploma
is
lacking
and
this
diploma
i
the
state
demand
ask
me
for
it
respectfully
first
then
we
will
see
what
is
to
be
done
this
therefore
is
the
freedom
of
competition
the
state
my
lord
first
qualifies
me
to
compete
but
do
persons
really
compete
no
again
things
only
moneys
in
the
first
place
etc
in
the
rivalry
one
will
always
be
left
behind
another
as
a
poetaster
behind
a
poet
but
it
makes
a
difference
whether
the
means
that
the
unlucky
competitor
lacks
are
personal
or
material
and
likewise
whether
the
material
means
can
be
won
by
personal
energy
or
are
to
be
obtained
only
by
grace
only
as
a
present
as
when
the
poorer
man
must
leave
that
is
present
to
the
rich
man
his
riches
but
if
i
must
all
along
wait
for
the
states
approval
to
obtain
or
to
use
as
in
the
case
of
graduation
the
means
i
have
the
means
by
the
grace
of
the
state

free
competition
therefore
has
only
the
following
meaning
to
the
state
all
rank
as
its
equal
children
and
every
one
can
scud
and
run
to
earn
the
states
goods
and
largesse
therefore
all
do
chase
after
havings
holdings
possessions
be
it
of
money
or
offices
titles
of
honour
etc
after
the
things
in
the
mind
of
the
commonalty
every
one
is
possessor
or
owner
now
whence
comes
it
that
the
most
have
in
fact
next
to
nothing
from
this
that
the
most
are
already
joyful
over
being
possessors
at
all
even
though
it
be
of
some
rags
as
children
are
joyful
in
their
first
trousers
or
even
the
first
penny
that
is
presented
to
them
more
precisely
however
the
matter
is
to
be
taken
as
follows
liberalism
came
forward
at
once
with
the
declaration
that
it
belonged
to
mans
essence
not
to
be
property
but
proprietor
as
the
consideration
here
was
about
man
not
about
the
individual
the
how
much
which
formed
exactly
the
point
of
the
individuals
special
interest
was
left
to
him
hence
the
individuals
egoism
retained
room
for
the
freest
play
in
this
how
much
and
carried
on
an
indefatigable
competition
however
the
lucky
egoism
had
to
become
a
snag
in
the
way
of
the
less
fortunate
and
the
latter
still
keeping
its
feet
planted
on
the
principle
of
humanity
put
forward
the
question
as
to
how
much
of
possession
and
answered
it
to
the
effect
that
man
must
have
as
much
as
he
requires
will
it
be
possible
for
my
egoism
to
let
itself
be
satisfied
with
that
what
man
requires
furnishes
by
no
means
a
scale
for
measuring
me
and
my
needs
for
i
may
have
use
for
less
or
more
i
must
rather
have
so
much
as
i
am
competent
to
appropriate
competition
suffers
from
the
unfavourable
circumstance
that
the
means
for
competing
are
not
at
every
ones
command
because
they
are
not
taken
from
personality
but
from
accident
most
are
without
means
and
for
this
reason
without
goods
hence
the
socialists
demand
the
means
for
all
and
aim
at
a
society
that
shall
offer
means
your
money
value
say
they
we
no
longer
recognize
as
your
competence
you
must
show
another
competence
q
to
wit
your
working
force
in
the
possession
of
a
property
or
as
possessor
man
does
certainly
show
himself
as
man
it
was
for
this
reason
that
we
let
the
possessor
whom
we
called
proprietor
keep
his
standing
so
long
yet
you
possess
the
things
only
so
long
as
you
are
not
put
out
of
this
property
the
possessor
is
competent
but
only
so
far
as
the
others
are
incompetent
since
your
ware
forms
your
competence
only
so
long
as
you
are
competent
to
defend
it
as
we
are
not
competent
to
do
anything
with
it
look
about
you
for
another
competence
for
we
now
by
our
might
surpass
your
alleged
competence
it
was
an
extraordinarily
large
gain
made
when
the
point
of
being
regarded
as
possessors
was
put
through
therein
bondservice
was
abolished
and
every
one
who
till
then
had
been
bound
to
the
lords
service
and
more
or
less
had
been
his
property
now
became
a
lord
but
henceforth
your
having
and
what
you
have
are
no
longer
adequate
and
no
longer
recognized
per
contra
your
working
and
your
work
rise
in
value
we
now
respect
your
subduing
things
as
we
formerly
did
your
possessing
them
your
work
is
your
competence
you
are
lord
or
possessor
only
of
what
comes
by
work
not
by
inheritance
but
as
at
the
time
everything
has
come
by
inheritance
and
every
copper
that
you
possess
bears
not
a
labour
stamp
but
an
inheritance
stamp
everything
must
be
melted
over
but
is
my
work
then
really
as
the
communists
suppose
my
sole
competence
or
does
not
this
consist
rather
in
everything
that
i
am
competent
for
and
does
not
the
workers
society
itself
have
to
concede
this
in
supporting
also
the
sick
children
old
men
q
in
short
those
who
are
incapable
of
work
these
are
still
competent
for
a
good
deal
for
instance
to
preserve
their
life
instead
of
taking
it
if
they
are
competent
to
cause
you
to
desire
their
continued
existence
they
have
a
power
over
you
to
him
who
exercised
utterly
no
power
over
you
you
would
vouchsafe
nothing
he
might
perish
therefore
what
you
are
competent
for
is
your
competence
if
you
are
competent
to
furnish
pleasure
to
thousands
then
thousands
will
pay
you
an
honorarium
for
it
for
it
would
stand
in
your
power
to
forbear
doing
it
hence
they
must
purchase
your
deed
if
you
are
not
competent
to
captivate
any
one
you
may
simply
starve
now
am
i
who
am
competent
for
much
perchance
to
have
no
advantage
over
the
less
competent
we
are
all
in
the
midst
of
abundance
now
shall
i
not
help
myself
as
well
as
i
can
but
only
wait
and
see
how
much
is
left
me
in
an
equal
division
against
competition
there
rises
up
the
principle
of
ragamuffin
society
q
partition
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
mere
part
part
of
society
the
individual
cannot
bear
q
because
he
is
more
his
uniqueness
puts
from
it
this
limited
conception
hence
he
does
not
await
his
competence
from
the
sharing
of
others
and
even
in
the
workers
society
there
arises
the
misgiving
that
in
an
equal
partition
the
strong
will
be
exploited
by
the
weak
he
awaits
his
competence
rather
from
himself
and
says
now
what
i
am
competent
to
have
that
is
my
competence
what
competence
does
not
the
child
possess
in
its
smiling
its
playing
its
screaming
in
short
in
its
mere
existence
are
you
capable
of
resisting
its
desire
or
do
you
not
hold
out
to
it
as
mother
your
breast
as
father
as
much
of
your
possessions
as
it
needs
it
compels
you
therefore
it
possesses
what
you
call
yours
if
your
person
is
of
consequence
to
me
you
pay
me
with
your
very
existence
if
i
am
concerned
only
with
one
of
your
qualities
then
your
compliance
perhaps
or
your
aid
has
a
value
a
money
value
for
me
and
i
purchase
it
if
you
do
not
know
how
to
give
yourself
any
other
than
a
money
value
in
my
estimation
there
may
arise
the
case
of
which
history
tells
us
that
germans
sons
of
the
fatherland
were
sold
to
america
should
those
who
let
themselves
to
be
traded
in
be
worth
more
to
the
seller
he
preferred
the
cash
to
this
living
ware
that
did
not
understand
how
to
make
itself
precious
to
him
that
he
discovered
nothing
more
valuable
in
it
was
assuredly
a
defect
of
his
competence
but
it
takes
a
rogue
to
give
more
than
he
has
how
should
he
show
respect
when
he
did
not
have
it
nay
hardly
could
have
it
for
such
a
pack
you
behave
egoistically
when
you
respect
each
other
neither
as
possessors
nor
as
ragamuffins
or
workers
but
as
a
part
of
your
competence
as
useful
bodies
then
you
will
neither
give
anything
to
the
possessor
proprietor
for
his
possessions
nor
to
him
who
works
but
only
to
him
whom
you
require
the
north
americans
ask
themselves
do
we
require
a
king
and
answer
not
a
farthing
are
he
and
his
work
worth
to
us
if
it
is
said
that
competition
throws
every
thing
open
to
all
the
expression
is
not
accurate
and
it
is
better
put
thus
competition
makes
everything
purchasable
in
abandoning

it
to
them
competition
leaves
it
to
their
appraisal
or
their
estimation
and
demands
a
price
for
it
but
the
would
be
buyers
mostly
lack
the
means
to
make
themselves
buyers
they
have
no
money
for
money
then
the
purchasable
things
are
indeed
to
be
had
for
money
everything
is
to
be
had
but
it
is
exactly
money
that
is
lacking
where
is
one
to
get
money
this
current
or
circulating
property
know
then
you
have
as
much
money
as
you
have
q
might
for
you
count
for
as
much
as
you
make
yourself
count
for
one
pays
not
with
money
of
which
there
may
come
a
lack
but
with
his
competence
by
which
alone
we
are
competent

for
one
is
proprietor
only
so
far
as
the
arm
of
our
power
reaches
weitling
has
thought
out
a
new
means
of
payment
q
work
but
the
true
means
of
payment
remains
as
always
competence
with
what
you
have
within
your
competence
you
pay
therefore
think
on
the
enlargement
of
your
competence
this
being
admitted
they
are
nevertheless
right
on
hand
again
with
the
motto
to
each
according
to
his
competence
who
is
to
give
to
me
according
to
my
competence
society
then
i
should
have
to
put
up
with
its
estimation
rather
i
shall
take
according
to
my
competence
all
belongs
to
all
this
proposition
springs
from
the
same
unsubstantial
theory
to
each
belongs
only
what
he
is
competent
for
if
i
say
the
world
belongs
to
me
properly
that
too
is
empty
talk
which
has
a
meaning
only
in
so
far
as
i
respect
no
alien
property
but
to
me
belongs
only
as
much
as
i
am
competent
for
or
have
within
my
competence
one
is
not
worthy
to
have
what
one
through
weakness
lets
be
taken
from
him
one
is
not
worthy
of
it
because
one
is
not
capable
of
it
they
raise
a
mighty
uproar
over
the
wrong
of
a
thousand
years
which
is
being
committed
by
the
rich
against
the
poor
as
if
the
rich
were
to
blame
for
poverty
and
the
poor
were
not
in
like
manner
responsible
for
riches
is
there
another
difference
between
the
two
than
that
of
competence
and
incompetence
of
the
competent
and
incompetent
wherein
pray
does
the
crime
of
the
rich
consist
in
their
hardheartedness
but
who
then
have
maintained
the
poor
who
have
cared
for
their
nourishment
who
have
given
alms
those
alms
that
have
even
their
name
from
mercy
eleemosyne
have
not
the
rich
been
merciful
at
all
times
are
they
not
to
this
day
tender
hearted
as
poor
taxes
hospitals
foundations
of
all
sorts
etc
prove
but
all
this
does
not
satisfy
you
doubtless
then
they
are
to
share
with
the
poor
now
you
are
demanding
that
they
shall
abolish
poverty
aside
from
the
point
that
there
might
be
hardly
one
among
you
who
would
act
so
and
that
this
one
would
be
a
fool
for
it
do
ask
yourselves
why
should
the
rich
let
go
their
fleeces
and
give
up
themselves
thereby
pursuing
the
advantage
of
the
poor
rather
than
their
own
you
who
have
your
thaler
daily
are
rich
above
thousands
who
live
on
four
groschen
is
it
for
your
interest
to
share
with
the
thousands
or
is
it
not
rather
for
theirs
with
competition
is
connected
less
the
intention
to
do
the
thing
best
than
the
intention
to
make
it
as
profitable
as
productive
as
possible
hence
people
study
to
get
into
the
civil
service
pot
boiling
study
study
cringing
and
flattery
routine
and
acquaintance
with
business
work
for
appearance
hence
while
it
is
apparently
a
matter
of
doing
good
service
in
truth
only
a
good
business
and
earning
of
money
are
looked
out
for
the
job
is
done
only
ostensibly
for
the
jobs
sake
but
in
fact
on
account
of
the
gain
that
it
yields
one
would
indeed
prefer
not
to
be
censor
but
one
wants
to
be
q
advanced
one
would
like
to
judge
administer
etc
according
to
his
best
convictions
but
one
is
afraid
of
transference
or
even
dismissal
one
must
above
all
things
q
live
thus
these
goings
on
are
a
fight
for
dear
life
and
in
gradation
upward
for
more
or
less
of
a
good
living
and
yet
withal
their
whole
round
of
toil
and
care
brings
in
for
most
only
bitter
life
and
bitter
poverty
all
the
bitter
painstaking
for
this
restless
acquisition
does
not
let
us
take
breath
take
a
calm
enjoyment
we
do
not
get
the
comfort
of
our
possessions
but
the
organization
of
labour
touches
only
such
labours
as
others
can
do
for
us
slaughtering
tillage
and
the
like
the
rest
remain
egoistic
because
no
one
can
in
your
stead
elaborate
your
musical
compositions
carry
out
your
projects
of
painting
etc
nobody
can
replace
raphaels
labours
the
latter
are
labours
of
a
unique
person

which
only
he
is
competent
to
achieve
while
the
former
deserved
to
be
called
human
since
what
is
anybodys
own
in
them
is
of
slight
account
and
almost
any
man
can
be
trained
to
it
now
as
society
can
regard
only
labours
for
the
common
benefit
human
labours
he
who
does
anything
unique
remains
without
its
care
nay
he
may
find
himself
disturbed
by
its
intervention
the
unique
person
will
work
himself
forth
out
of
society
all
right
but
society
brings
forth
no
unique
person
hence
it
is
at
any
rate
helpful
that
we
come
to
an
agreement
about
human
labours
that
they
may
not
as
under
competition
claim
all
our
time
and
toil
so
far
communism
will
bear
its
fruits
for
before
the
dominion
of
the
commonalty
even
that
for
which
all
men
are
qualified
or
can
be
qualified
was
tied
up
to
a
few
and
withheld
from
the
rest
it
was
a
privilege
to
the
commonalty
it
looked
equitable
to
leave
free
all
that
seemed
to
exist
for
every
man
but
because
left
free
it
was
yet
given
to
no
one
but
rather
left
to
each
to
be
got
hold
of
by
his
human
power
by
this
the
mind
was
turned
to
the
acquisition
of
the
human
which
henceforth
beckoned
to
every
one
and
there
arose
a
movement
which
one
hears
so
loudly
bemoaned
under
the
name
of
materialism
communism
seeks
to
check
its
course
spreading
the
belief
that
the
human
is
not
worth
so
much
discomfort
and
with
sensible
arrangements
could
be
gained
without
the
great
expense
of
time
and
powers
which
has
hitherto
seemed
requisite
but
for
whom
is
time
to
be
gained
for
what
does
man
require
more
time
than
is
necessary
to
refresh
his
wearied
powers
of
labour
here
communism
is
silent
for
what
to
take
comfort
in
himself
as
the
unique
after
he
has
done
his
part
as
man
in
the
first
joy
over
being
allowed
to
stretch
out
their
hands
toward
everything
human
people
forgot
to
want
anything
else
and
they
competed
away
vigorously
as
if
the
possession
of
the
human
were
the
goal
of
all
our
wishes
but
they
have
run
themselves
tired
and
are
gradually
noticing
that
possession
does
not
give
happiness
therefore
they
are
thinking
of
obtaining
the
necessary
by
an
easier
bargain
and
spending
on
it
only
so
much
time
and
toil
as
its
indispensableness
exacts
riches
fall
in
price
and
contented
poverty
the
care
free
ragamuffin
becomes
the
seductive
ideal
should
such
human
activities
that
every
one
is
confident
of
his
capacity
for
be
highly
salaried
and
sought
for
with
toil
and
expenditure
of
all
life
forces
even
in
the
every
day
form
of
speech
if
i
were
minister
or
even
the
then
it
should
go
quite
otherwise
that
confidence
expresses
itself
q
that
one
holds
himself
capable
of
playing
the
part
of
such
a
dignitary
one
does
get
a
perception
that
to
things
of
this
sort
there
belongs
not
uniqueness
but
only
a
culture
which
is
attainable
even
if
not
exactly
by
all
at
any
rate
by
many
that
for
such
a
thing
one
need
only
be
an
ordinary
man
if
we
assume
that
as
order
belongs
to
the
essence
of
the
state
so
subordination
too
is
founded
in
its
nature
then
we
see
that
the
subordinates
or
those
who
have
received
preferment
disproportionately
overcharge
and
overreach
those
who
are
put
in
the
lower
ranks
but
the
latter
take
heart
first
from
the
socialist
stand
point
but
certainly
with
egoistic
consciousness
later
of
which
we
will
therefore
at
once
give
their
speech
some
colouring
for
the
question
by
what
then
is
your
property
secure
you
creatures
of
preferment
q
and
give
themselves
the
answer
by
our
refraining
from
interference
and
so
by
our
protection
and
what
do
you
give
us
for
it
kicks
and
disdain
you
give
to
the
common
people
police
supervision
and
a
catechism
with
the
chief
sentence
respect
what
is
not
yours
what
belongs
to
others
respect
others
and
especially
your
superiors
but
we
reply
if
you
want
our
respect
buy
it
for
a
price
agreeable
to
us
we
will
leave
you
your
property
if
you
give
a
due
equivalent
for
this
leaving
really
what
equivalent
does
the
general
in
time
of
peace
give
for
the
many
thousands
of
his
yearly
income
q
another
for
the
sheer
hundred
thousands
and
millions
yearly
what
equivalent
do
you
give
for
our
chewing
potatoes
and
looking
calmly
on
while
you
swallow
oysters
only
buy
the
oysters
of
us
as
dear
as
we
have
to
buy
the
potatoes
of
you
then
you
may
go
on
eating
them
or
do
you
suppose
the
oysters
do
not
belong
to
us
as
much
as
to
you
you
will
make
an
outcry
over
violence
if
we
reach
out
our
hands
and
help
consume
them
and
you
are
right
without
violence
we
do
not
get
them
as
you
no
less
have
them
by
doing
violence
to
us
but
take
the
oysters
and
have
done
with
it
and
let
us
consider
our
nearer
property
labour
for
the
other
is
only
possession
we
distress
ourselves
twelve
hours
in
the
sweat
of
our
face
and
you
offer
us
a
few
groschen
for
it
then
take
the
like
for
your
labour
too
are
you
not
willing
you
fancy
that
our
labour
is
richly
repaid
with
that
wage
while
yours
on
the
other
hands
is
worth
a
wage
of
many
thousands
but
if
you
did
not
rate
yours
so
high
and
gave
us
a
better
chance
to
realize
value
from
ours
then
we
might
well
if
the
case
demanded
it
bring
to
pass
still
more
important
things
than
you
do
for
the
many
thousand
thalers
and
if
you
got
only
such
wages
as
we
you
would
soon
grow
more
industrious
in
order
to
receive
more
but
if
you
render
any
service
that
seems
to
us
worth
ten
and
a
hundred
times
more
than
our
own
labour
why
then
you
shall
get
a
hundred
times
more
for
it
too
we
on
the
other
hand
think
also
to
produce
for
you
things
for
which
you
will
requite
us
more
highly
than
with
the
ordinary
days
wages
we
shall
be
willing
to
get
along
with
each
other
all
right
if
only
we
have
first
agreed
on
this
q
that
neither
any
longer
needs
to
q
present
anything
to
the
other
then
we
may
perhaps
actually
go
so
far
as
to
pay
even
the
cripples
and
sick
and
old
an
appropriate
price
for
not
parting
from
us
by
hunger
and
want
for
if
we
want
them
to
live
it
is
fitting
also
that
we
q
purchase
the
fulfilment
of
our
will
i
say
purchase
and
therefore
do
not
mean
a
wretched
alms
for
their
life
is
the
property
even
of
those
who
cannot
work
if
we
no
matter
for
what
reason
want
them
not
to
withdraw
this
life
from
us
we
can
mean
to
bring
this
to
pass
only
by
purchase
nay
we
shall
perhaps
maybe
because
we
like
to
have
friendly
faces
about
us
even
want
a
life
of
comfort
for
them
in
short
we
want
nothing
presented
by
you
but
neither
will
we
present
you
with
anything
for
centuries
we
have
handed
alms
to
you
from
goodhearted
q
stupidity
have
doled
out
the
mite
of
the
poor
and
given
to
the
masters
the
things
that
are
q
not
the
masters
now
just
open
your
wallet
for
henceforth
our
ware
rises
in
price
quite
enormously
we
do
not
want
to
take
from
you
anything
anything
at
all
only
you
are
to
pay
better
for
what
you
want
to
have
what
then
have
you
i
have
an
estate
of
a
thousand
acres
and
i
am
your
plowman
and
will
henceforth
attend
to
your
fields
only
for
one
thaler
a
day
wages
then
ill
take
another
you
wont
find
any
for
we
plowmen
are
no
longer
doing
otherwise
and
if
one
puts
in
an
appearance
who
takes
less
then
let
him
beware
of
us
there
is
the
housemaid
she
too
is
now
demanding
as
much
and
you
will
no
longer
find
one
below
this
price
why
then
it
is
all
over
with
me
not
so
fast
you
will
doubtless
take
in
as
much
as
we
and
if
it
should
not
be
so
we
will
take
off
so
much
that
you
shall
have
wherewith
to
live
like
us
but
i
am
accustomed
to
live
better
we
have
nothing
against
that
but
it
is
not
our
look
out
if
you
can
clear
more
go
ahead
are
we
to
hire
out
under
rates
that
you
may
have
a
good
living
the
rich
man
always
puts
off
the
poor
with
the
words
what
does
your
want
concern
me
see
to
it
how
you
make
your
way
through
the
world
that
is
your
affair
not
mine
well
let
us
let
it
be
our
affair
then
and
let
us
not
let
the
means
that
we
have
to
realize
value
from
ourselves
be
pilfered
from
us
by
the
rich
but
you
uncultured
people
really
do
not
need
so
much
well
we
are
taking
somewhat
more
in
order
that
for
it
we
may
procure
the
culture
that
we
perhaps
need
but
if
you
thus
bring
down
the
rich
who
is
then
to
support
the
arts
and
sciences
hereafter
oh
well
we
must
make
it
up
by
numbers
we
club
together
that
gives
a
nice
little
sum
q
besides
you
rich
men
now
buy
only
the
most
tasteless
books
and
the
most
lamentable
madonnas
or
a
pair
of
lively
dancers
legs
o
ill
starred
equality
no
my
good
old
sir
nothing
of
equality
we
only
want
to
count
for
what
we
are
worth
and
if
you
are
worth
more
you
shall
count
for
more
right
along
we
only
want
to
be
worth
our
price
and
think
to
show
ourselves
worth
the
price
that
you
will
pay
is
the
state
likely
to
be
able
to
awaken
so
secure
a
temper
and
so
forceful
a
self
consciousness
in
the
menial
can
it
make
man
feel
himself
nay
may
it
even
do
so
much
as
set
this
goal
for
itself
can
it
want
the
individual
to
recognize
his
value
and
realize
this
value
from
himself
let
us
keep
the
parts
of
the
double
question
separate
and
see
first
whether
the
state
can
bring
about
such
a
thing
as
the
unanimity
of
the
plowmen
is
required
only
this
unanimity
can
bring
it
to
pass
and
a
state
law
would
be
evaded
in
a
thousand
ways
by
competition
and
in
secret
but
can
the
state
bear
with
it
the
state
cannot
possibly
bear
with
peoples
suffering
coercion
from
another
than
it
it
could
not
therefore
admit
the
self
help
of
the
unanimous
plowmen
against
those
who
want
to
engage
for
lower
wages
suppose
however
that
the
state
made
the
law
and
all
the
plowmen
were
in
accord
with
it
could
the
state
bear
with
it
then
in
the
isolated
case
q
yes
but
the
isolated
case
is
more
than
that
it
is
a
case
of
principle
the
question
therein
is
of
the
whole
range
of
the
egos
self
realization
of
value
from
himself
and
therefore
also
of
his
self
consciousness
against
the
state
so
far
the
communists
keep
company
but
as
self
realization
of
value
from
self
necessarily
directs
itself
against
the
state
so
it
does
against
society
too
and
therewith
reaches
out
beyond
the
commune
and
the
communistic
q
out
of
egoism
communism
makes
the
maxim
of
the
commonalty
that
every
one
is
a
possessor
proprietor
into
an
irrefragable
truth
into
a
reality
since
the
anxiety
about
obtaining
now
ceases
and
every
one
has
from
the
start
what
he
requires
in
his
labour
force
he
has
his
competence
and
if
he
makes
no
use
of
it
that
is
his
fault
the
grasping
and
hounding
is
at
an
end
and
no
competition
is
left
as
so
often
now
without
fruit
because
with
every
stroke
of
labour
an
adequate
supply
of
the
needful
is
brought
into
the
house
now
for
the
first
time
one
is
a
real
possessor
because
what
one
has
in
his
labour
force
can
no
longer
escape
from
him
as
it
was
continually
threatening
to
do
under
the
system
of
competition
one
is
a
care
free
and
assured
possessor
and
one
is
this
precisely
by
seeking
his
competence
no
longer
in
a
ware
but
in
his
own
labour
his
competence
for
labour
and
therefore
by
being
a
ragamuffin
a
man
of
only
ideal
wealth
i
however
cannot
content
myself
with
the
little
that
i
scrape
up
by
my
competence
for
labour
because
my
competence
does
not
consist
merely
in
my
labour
by
labour
i
can
perform
the
official
functions
of
a
president
a
minister
etc
these
offices
demand
only
a
general
culture
q
to
wit
such
a
culture
as
is
generally
attainable
for
general
culture
is
not
merely
that
which
every
one
has
attained
but
broadly
that
which
every
one
can
attain
and
therefore
every
special
culture
medical
military
philological
of
which
no
cultivated
man
believes
that
they
surpass
his
powers
or
broadly
only
a
skill
possible
to
all
but
even
if
these
offices
may
vest
in
every
one
yet
it
is
only
the
individuals
unique
force
peculiar
to
him
alone
that
gives
them
so
to
speak
life
and
significance
that
he
does
not
manage
his
office
like
an
ordinary
man
but
puts
in
the
competence
of
his
uniqueness
this
he
is
not
yet
paid
for
when
he
is
paid
only
in
general
as
an
official
or
a
minister
if
he
has
done
it
so
as
to
earn
your
thanks
and
you
wish
to
retain
this
thank
worthy
force
of
the
unique
one
you
must
not
pay
him
like
a
mere
man
who
performed
only
what
was
human
but
as
one
who
accomplishes
what
is
unique
do
the
like
with
your
labour
do
there
cannot
be
a
general
schedule
price
fixed
for
my
uniqueness
as
there
can
for
what
i
do
as
man
only
for
the
latter
can
a
schedule
price
be
set
go
right
on
then
setting
up
a
general
appraisal
for
human
labours
but
do
not
deprive
your
uniqueness
of
its
desert
human
or
general
needs
can
be
satisfied
through
society
for
satisfaction
of
unique
needs
you
must
do
some
seeking
a
friend
and
a
friendly
service
or
even
an
individuals
service
society
cannot
procure
you
and
yet
you
will
every
moment
be
in
need
of
such
a
service
and
on
the
slightest
occasions
require
somebody
who
is
helpful
to
you
therefore
do
not
rely
on
society
but
see
to
it
that
you
have
the
wherewithal
to
q
purchase
the
fulfilment
of
your
wishes
whether
money
is
to
be
retained
among
egoists
to
the
old
stamp
an
inherited
possession
adheres
if
you
no
longer
let
yourselves
be
paid
with
it
it
is
ruined
if
you
do
nothing
for
this
money
it
loses
all
power
cancel
the
inheritance
and
you
have
broken
off
the
executors
court
seal
for
now
everything
is
an
inheritance
whether
it
be
already
inherited
or
await
its
heir
if
it
is
yours
wherefore
do
you
let
it
be
sealed
up
from
you
why
do
you
respect
the
seal
but
why
should
you
not
create
a
new
money
do
you
then
annihilate
the
ware
in
taking
from
it
the
hereditary
stamp
now
money
is
a
ware
and
an
essential
means
or
competence
for
it
protects
against
the
ossification
of
resources
keeps
them
in
flux
and
brings
to
pass
their
exchange
if
you
know
a
better
medium
of
exchange
go
ahead
yet
it
will
be
a
money
again
it
is
not
the
money
that
does
you
damage
but
your
incompetence
to
take
it
let
your
competence
take
effect
collect
yourselves
and
there
will
be
no
lack
of
money
q
of
your
money
the
money
of
your
stamp
but
working
i
do
not
call
letting
your
competence
take
effect
those
who
are
only
looking
for
work
and
willing
to
work
hard
are
preparing
for
their
own
selves
the
infallible
upshot
q
to
be
out
of
work
good
and
bad
luck
depend
on
money
it
is
a
power
in
the
bourgeois
period
for
this
reason
that
it
is
only
wooed
on
all
hands
like
a
girl
indissolubly
wedded
by
nobody
all
the
romance
and
chivalry
of
wooing
for
a
dear
object
come
to
life
again
in
competition
money
an
object
of
longing
is
carried
off
by
the
bold
knights
of
industry

he
who
has
luck
takes
home
the
bride
the
ragamuffin
has
luck
he
takes
her
into
his
household
society
and
destroys
the
virgin
in
his
house
she
is
no
longer
bride
but
wife
and
with
her
virginity
her
family
name
is
also
lost
as
housewife
the
maiden
money
is
called
labour
for
labour
is
her
husbands
name
she
is
a
possession
of
her
husbands
to
bring
this
figure
to
an
end
the
child
of
labour
and
money
is
again
a
girl
an
unwedded
one
and
therefore
money
but
with
the
certain
descent
from
labour
her
father
the
form
of
the
face
the
effigy
bears
another
stamp
finally
as
regards
competition
once
more
it
has
a
continued
existence
by
this
very
means
that
all
do
not
attend
to
their
affair
and
come
to
an
understanding
with
each
other
about
it
bread
is
a
need
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
a
city
therefore
they
might
easily
agree
on
setting
up
a
public
bakery
instead
of
this
they
leave
the
furnishing
of
the
needful
to
the
competing
bakers
just
so
meat
to
the
butchers
wine
to
wine
dealers
etc
abolishing
competition
is
not
equivalent
to
favouring
the
guild
the
difference
is
this
in
the
guild
baking
etc
is
the
affair
of
the
guild
brothers
in
competition
the
affair
of
chance
competitors
in
the
union
of
those
who
require
baked
goods
and
therefore
my
affair
yours
the
affair
of
neither
the
guildic
nor
the
concessionary
baker
but
the
affair
of
the
united
if
i
do
not
trouble
myself
about
my
affair
i
must
be
content
with
what
it
pleases
others
to
vouchsafe
me
to
have
bread
is
my
affair
my
wish
and
desire
and
yet
people
leave
that
to
the
bakers
and
hope
at
most
to
obtain
through
their
wrangling
their
getting
ahead
of
each
other
their
rivalry
q
in
short
their
competition
q
an
advantage
which
one
could
not
count
on
in
the
case
of
the
guild
brothers
who
were
lodged
entirely
and
alone
in
the
proprietorship
of
the
baking
franchise
q
what
every
one
requires
every
one
should
also
take
a
hand
in
procuring
and
producing
it
is
his
affair
his
property
not
the
property
of
the
guildic
or
concessionary
master
let
us
look
back
once
more
the
world
belongs
to
the
children
of
this
world
the
children
of
men
it
is
no
longer
gods
world
but
mans
as
much
as
every
man
can
procure
of
it
let
him
call
his
only
the
true
man
the
state
human
society
or
mankind
will
look
to
it
that
each
shall
make
nothing
else
his
own
than
what
he
appropriates
as
man
in
human
fashion
unhuman
appropriation
is
that
which
is
not
consented
to
by
man
that
is
it
is
a
criminal
appropriation
as
the
human
vice
versa
is
a
rightful
one
one
acquired
in
the
way
of
law
so
they
talk
since
the
revolution
but
my
property
is
not
a
thing
since
this
has
an
existence
independent
of
me
only
my
might
is
my
own
not
this
tree
but
my
might
or
control
over
it
is
what
is
mine
now
how
is
this
might
perversely
expressed
they
say
i
have
a
right
to
this
tree
or
it
is
my
rightful
property
so
i
have
earned
it
by
might
that
the
might
must
last
in
order
that
the
tree
may
also
be
held
or
better
that
the
might
is
not
a
thing
existing
of
itself
but
has
existence
solely
in
the
mighty
ego
in
me
the
mighty
q
is
forgotten
might
like
other
of
my
qualities
humanity
majesty
etc
is
exalted
to
something
existing
of
itself
so
that
it
still
exists
long
after
it
has
ceased
to
be
my
might
thus
transformed
into
a
ghost
might
is
q
right
this
eternalized
might
is
not
extinguished
even
with
my
death
but
is
transferred
to
bequeathed
things
now
really
belong
not
to
me
but
to
right
on
the
other
side
this
is
nothing
but
a
hallucination
of
vision
for
the
individuals
might
becomes
permanent
and
a
right
only
by
others
joining
their
might
with
his
the
delusion
consists
in
their
believing
that
they
cannot
withdraw
their
might
the
same
phenomenon
over
again
might
is
separated
from
me
i
cannot
take
back
the
might
that
i
gave
to
the
possessor
one
has
granted
power
of
attorney
has
given
away
his
power
has
renounced
coming
to
a
better
mind
the
proprietor
can
give
up
his
might
and
his
right
to
a
thing
by
giving
the
thing
away
squandering
it
and
the
like
and
we
should
not
be
able
likewise
to
let
go
the
might
that
we
lend
to
him
the
rightful
man
the
just
desires
to
call
nothing
his
own
that
he
does
not
have
rightly
or
have
the
right
to
and
therefore
only
legitimate
property
now
who
is
to
be
judge
and
adjudge
his
right
to
him
at
last
surely
man
who
imparts
to
him
the
rights
of
man
then
he
can
say
in
an
infinitely
broader
sense
than
terence
humani
nihil
a
me
alienum
puto
that
is
the
human
is
my
property
however
he
may
go
about
it
so
long
as
he
occupies
this
stand
point
he
cannot
get
clear
of
a
judge
and
in
our
time
the
multifarious
judges
that
had
been
selected
have
set
themselves
against
each
other
in
two
persons
at
deadly
enmity
q
to
wit
in
god
and
man
the
one
party
appeal
to
divine
right
the
other
to
human
right
or
the
rights
of
man
so
much
is
clear
that
in
neither
case
does
the
individual
do
the
entitling
himself
just
pick
me
out
an
action
today
that
would
not
be
a
violation
of
right
every
moment
the
rights
of
man
are
trampled
under
foot
by
one
side
while
their
opponents
cannot
open
their
mouth
without
uttering
a
blasphemy
against
divine
right
give
an
alms
you
mock
at
a
right
of
man
because
the
relation
of
beggar
and
benefactor
is
an
inhuman
relation
utter
a
doubt
you
sin
against
a
divine
right
eat
dry
bread
with
contentment
you
violate
the
right
of
man
by
your
equanimity
eat
it
with
discontent
you
revile
divine
right
by
your
repining
there
is
not
one
among
you
who
does
not
commit
a
crime
at
every
moment
your
speeches
are
crimes
and
every
hindrance
to
your
freedom
of
speech
is
no
less
a
crime
ye
are
criminals
altogether
yet
you
are
so
only
in
that
you
all
stand
on
the
ground
of
right
in
that
you
do
not
even
know
and
understand
how
to
value
the
fact
that
you
are
criminals
inviolable
or
sacred
property
has
grown
on
this
very
ground
it
is
a
juridical
concept
a
dog
sees
the
bone
in
anothers
power
and
stands
off
only
if
it
feels
itself
too
weak
but
man
respects
the
others
right
to
his
bone
the
latter
action
therefore
ranks
as
human
the
former
as
brutal
or
egoistic
and
as
here
so
in
general
it
is
called
human
when
one
sees
in
everything
something
spiritual
here
right
makes
everything
a
ghost
and
takes
his
attitude
toward
it
as
toward
a
ghost
which
one
can
indeed
scare
away
at
its
appearance
but
cannot
kill
it
is
human
to
look
at
what
is
individual
not
as
individual
but
as
a
generality
in
nature
as
such
i
no
longer
respect
anything
but
know
myself
to
be
entitled
to
everything
against
it
in
the
tree
in
that
garden
on
the
other
hand
i
must
respect
alienness
they
say
in
one
sided
fashion
property
i
must
keep
my
hand
off
it
this
comes
to
an
end
only
when
i
can
indeed
leave
that
tree
to
another
as
i
leave
my
stick
etc
to
another
but
do
not
in
advance
regard
it
as
alien
to
me
sacred
rather
i
make
to
myself
no
crime
of
felling
it
if
i
will
and
it
remains
my
property
however
long
as
i
resign
it
to
others
it
is
and
remains
mine
in
the
bankers
fortune
i
as
little
see
anything
alien
as
napoleon
did
in
the
territories
of
kings
we
have
no
dread
of
conquering
it
and
we
look
about
us
also
for
the
means
thereto
we
strip
off
from
it
therefore
the
spirit
of
alienness
of
which
we
had
been
afraid
therefore
it
is
necessary
that
i
do
not
lay
claim
to
anything
more
as
man
but
to
everything
as
i
this
i
and
accordingly
to
nothing
human
but
to
mine
that
is
nothing
that
pertains
to
me
as
man
but
q
what
i
will
and
because
i
will
it
rightful
or
legitimate
property
of
another
will
be
only
that
which
you
are
content
to
recognize
as
such
if
your
content
ceases
then
this
property
has
lost
legitimacy
for
you
and
you
will
laugh
at
absolute
right
to
it
besides
the
hitherto
discussed
property
in
the
limited
sense
there
is
held
up
to
our
reverent
heart
another
property
against
which
we
are
far
less
to
sin
this
property
consists
in
spiritual
goods
in
the
sanctuary
of
the
inner
nature
what
a
man
holds
sacred
no
other
is
to
gibe
at
because
untrue
as
it
may
be
and
zealously
as
one
may
in
loving
and
modest
wise
seek
to
convince
of
a
true
sanctity
the
man
who
adheres
to
it
and
believes
in
it
yet
the
sacred
itself
is
always
to
be
honoured
in
it
the
mistaken
man
does
believe
in
the
sacred
even
though
in
an
incorrect
essence
of
it
and
so
his
belief
in
the
sacred
must
at
least
be
respected
in
ruder
times
than
ours
it
was
customary
to
demand
a
particular
faith
and
devotion
to
a
particular
sacred
essence
and
they
did
not
take
the
gentlest
way
with
those
who
believed
otherwise
since
however
freedom
of
belief
spread
itself
more
and
more
abroad
the
jealous
god
and
sole
lord
gradually
melted
into
a
pretty
general
supreme
being
and
it
satisfied
humane
tolerance
if
only
every
one
revered
something
sacred
reduced
to
the
most
human
expression
this
sacred
essence
is
man
himself
and
the
human
with
the
deceptive
semblance
as
if
the
human
were
altogether
our
own
and
free
from
all
the
otherworldliness
with
which
the
divine
is
tainted
q
yes
as
if
man
were
as
much
as
i
or
you
q
there
may
arise
even
the
proud
fancy
that
the
talk
is
no
longer
of
a
sacred
essence
and
that
we
now
feel
ourselves
everywhere
at
home
and
no
longer
in
the
uncanny

in
the
sacred
and
in
sacred
awe
in
the
ecstasy
over
man
discovered
at
last
the
egoistic
cry
of
pain
passes
unheard
and
the
spook
that
has
become
so
intimate
is
taken
for
our
true
ego
but
humanus
is
the
saints
name
see
goethe
and
the
humane
is
only
the
most
clarified
sanctity
the
egoist
makes
the
reverse
declaration
for
this
precise
reason
because
you
hold
something
sacred
i
gibe
at
you
and
even
if
i
respected
everything
in
you
your
sanctuary
is
precisely
what
i
should
not
respect
with
these
opposed
views
there
must
also
be
assumed
a
contradictory
relation
to
spiritual
goods
the
egoist
insults
them
the
religious
man
every
one
who
puts
his
essence
above
himself
must
consistently
q
protect
them
but
what
kind
of
spiritual
goods
are
to
be
protected
and
what
left
unprotected
depends
entirely
on
the
concept
that
one
forms
of
the
supreme
being
and
he
who
fears
god
for
example
has
more
to
shelter
than
he
the
liberal
who
fears
man
in
spiritual
goods
we
are
in
distinction
from
the
sensuous
injured
in
a
spiritual
way
and
the
sin
against
them
consists
in
a
direct
desecration
while
against
the
sensuous
a
purloining
or
alienation
takes
place
the
goods
themselves
are
robbed
of
value
and
of
consecration
not
merely
taken
away
the
sacred
is
immediately
compromised
with
the
word
irreverence
or
flippancy
is
designated
everything
that
can
be
committed
as
crime
against
spiritual
goods
against
everything
that
is
sacred
for
us
and
scoffing
reviling
contempt
doubt
and
the
like
are
only
different
shades
of
criminal
flippancy
that
desecration
can
be
practiced
in
the
most
manifold
way
is
here
to
be
passed
over
and
only
that
desecration
is
to
be
preferentially
mentioned
which
threatens
the
sacred
with
danger
through
an
unrestricted
press
as
long
as
respect
is
demanded
even
for
one
spiritual
essence
speech
and
the
press
must
be
enthralled
in
the
name
of
this
essence
for
just
so
long
the
egoist
might
trespass
against
it
by
his
utterances
from
which
thing
he
must
be
hindered
by
due
punishment
at
least
if
one
does
not
prefer
to
take
up
the
more
correct
means
against
it
the
preventive
use
of
police
authority
such
as
censorship
what
a
sighing
for
liberty
of
the
press
what
then
is
the
press
to
be
liberated
from
surely
from
a
dependence
a
belonging
and
a
liability
to
service
but
to
liberate
himself
from
that
is
every
ones
affair
and
it
may
with
safety
be
assumed
that
when
you
have
delivered
yourself
from
liability
to
service
that
which
you
compose
and
write
will
also
belong
to
you
as
your
own
instead
of
having
been
thought
and
indicted
in
the
service
of
some
power
what
can
a
believer
in
christ
say
and
have
printed
that
should
be
freer
from
that
belief
in
christ
than
he
himself
is
if
i
cannot
or
may
not
write
something
perhaps
the
primary
fault
lies
with
me
little
as
this
seems
to
hit
the
point
so
near
is
the
application
nevertheless
to
be
found
by
a
press
law
i
draw
a
boundary
for
my
publications
or
let
one
be
drawn
beyond
which
wrong
and
its
punishment
follows
i
myself
limit
myself
if
the
press
was
to
be
free
nothing
would
be
so
important
as
precisely
its
liberation
from
every
coercion
that
could
be
put
on
it
in
the
name
of
a
law
and
that
it
might
come
to
that
i
my
own
self
should
have
to
have
absolved
myself
from
obedience
to
the
law
certainly
the
absolute
liberty
of
the
press
is
like
every
absolute
liberty
a
nonentity
the
press
can
become
free
from
full
many
a
thing
but
always
only
from
what
i
too
am
free
from
if
we
make
ourselves
free
from
the
sacred
if
we
have
become
graceless
and
lawless
our
words
too
will
become
so
as
little
as
we
can
be
declared
clear
of
every
coercion
in
the
world
so
little
can
our
writing
be
withdrawn
from
it
but
as
free
as
we
are
so
free
we
can
make
it
too
it
must
therefore
become
our
own
instead
of
as
hitherto
serving
a
spook
people
do
not
yet
know
what
they
mean
by
their
cry
for
liberty
of
the
press
what
they
ostensibly
ask
is
that
the
state
shall
set
the
press
free
but
what
they
are
really
after
without
knowing
it
themselves
is
that
the
press
become
free
from
the
the
state
or
clear
of
the
state
the
former
is
a
petition
to
the
state
the
latter
an
insurrection
against
the
state
as
a
petition
for
right
even
as
a
serious
demanding
of
the
right
of
liberty
of
the
press
it
presupposes
the
state
as
the
giver
and
can
hope
only
for
a
present
a
permission
a
chartering
possible
no
doubt
that
a
state
acts
so
senselessly
as
to
grant
the
demanded
present
but
you
may
bet
everything
that
those
who
receive
the
present
will
not
know
how
to
use
it
so
long
as
they
regard
the
state
as
a
truth
they
will
not
trespass
against
this
sacred
thing
and
will
call
for
a
penal
press
law
against
every
one
who
would
be
willing
to
dare
this
in
a
word
the
press
does
not
become
free
from
what
i
am
not
free
from
do
i
perhaps
hereby
show
myself
an
opponent
of
the
liberty
of
the
press
on
the
contrary
i
only
assert
that
one
will
never
get
it
if
one
wants
only
it
the
liberty
of
the
press
if
one
sets
out
only
for
an
unrestricted
permission
only
beg
right
along
for
this
permission
you
may
wait
forever
for
it
for
there
is
no
one
in
the
world
who
could
give
it
to
you
as
long
as
you
want
to
have
yourselves
entitled
to
the
use
of
the
press
by
a
permission
you
live
in
vain
hope
and
complaint
nonsense
why
you
yourself
who
harbour
such
thoughts
as
stand
in
your
book
can
unfortunately
bring
them
to
publicity
only
through
a
lucky
chance
or
by
stealth
nevertheless
you
will
inveigh
against
ones
pressing
and
importuning
his
own
state
till
it
gives
the
refused
permission
to
print
but
an
author
thus
addressed
would
perhaps
q
for
the
impudence
of
such
people
goes
far
q
give
the
following
reply
consider
well
what
you
say
what
then
do
i
do
to
procure
myself
liberty
of
the
press
for
my
book
do
i
ask
for
permission
or
do
i
not
rather
without
any
question
of
legality
seek
a
favourable
occasion
and
grasp
it
in
complete
recklessness
of
the
state
and
its
wishes
i
q
the
terrifying
word
must
be
uttered
q
i
cheat
the
state
you
unconsciously
do
the
same
from
your
tribunes
you
talk
it
into
the
idea
that
it
must
give
up
its
sanctity
and
inviolability
it
must
lay
itself
bare
to
the
attacks
of
writers
without
needing
on
that
account
to
fear
danger
but
you
are
imposing
on
it
for
its
existence
is
done
for
as
soon
as
it
loses
its
unapproachableness
to
you
indeed
it
might
well
accord
liberty
of
writing
as
england
has
done
you
are
believers
in
the
state
and
incapable
of
writing
against
the
state
however
much
you
would
like
to
reform
it
and
remedy
its
defects

but
what
if
opponents
of
the
state
availed
themselves
of
free
utterance
and
stormed
out
against
church
state
morals
and
everything
sacred
with
inexorable
reasons
you
would
then
be
the
first
in
terrible
agonies
to
call
into
life
the
september
laws

too
late
would
you
then
rue
the
stupidity
that
earlier
made
you
so
ready
to
fool
and
palaver
into
compliance
the
state
or
the
government
of
the
state
q
but
i
prove
by
my
act
only
two
things
this
for
one
that
the
liberty
of
the
press
is
always
bound
to
favourable
opportunities

and
accordingly
will
never
be
an
absolute
liberty
but
secondly
this
that
he
who
would
enjoy
it
must
seek
out
and
if
possible
create
the
favourable
opportunity
availing
himself
of
his
own
advantage
against
the
state
and
counting
himself
and
his
will
more
than
the
state
and
every
superior
power
not
in
the
state
but
only
against
it
can
the
liberty
of
the
press
be
carried
through
if
it
is
to
be
established
it
is
to
be
obtained
not
as
the
consequence
of
a
petition
but
as
the
work
of
an
insurrection
every
petition
and
every
motion
for
liberty
of
the
press
is
already
an
insurrection
be
it
conscious
or
unconscious
a
thing
which
philistine
halfness
alone
will
not
and
cannot
confess
to
itself
until
with
a
shrinking
shudder
it
shall
see
it
clearly
and
irrefutably
by
the
outcome
for
the
requested
liberty
of
the
press
has
indeed
a
friendly
and
well
meaning
face
at
the
beginning
as
it
is
not
in
the
least
minded
ever
to
let
the
insolence
of
the
press
come
into
vogue
but
little
by
little
its
heart
grows
more
hardened
and
the
inference
flatters
its
way
in
that
really
a
liberty
is
not
a
liberty
if
it
stands
in
the
service
of
the
state
of
morals
or
of
the
law
a
liberty
indeed
from
the
coercion
of
censorship
it
is
yet
not
a
liberty
from
the
coercion
of
law
the
press
once
seized
by
the
lust
for
liberty
always
wants
to
grow
freer
till
at
last
the
writer
says
to
himself
really
i
am
not
wholly
free
till
i
ask
about
nothing
and
writing
is
free
only
when
it
is
my
own
dictated
to
me
by
no
power
or
authority
by
no
faith
no
dread
the
press
must
not
be
free
q
that
is
too
little
q
it
must
be
mine
q
ownness
of
the
press
or
property
in
the
press
that
is
what
i
will
take
why
liberty
of
the
press
is
only
permission
of
the
press
and
the
state
never
will
or
can
voluntarily
permit
me
to
grind
it
to
nothingness
by
the
press
let
us
now
in
conclusion
bettering
the
above
language
which
is
still
vague
owing
to
the
phrase
liberty
of
the
press

rather
put
it
thus
liberty
of
the
press
the
liberals
loud
demand
is
assuredly
possible
in
the
state
yes
it
is
possible
only
in
the
state
because
it
is
a
permission
and
consequently
the
permitter
the
state
must
not
be
lacking
but
as
permission
it
has
its
limit
in
this
very
state
which
surely
should
not
in
reason
permit
more
than
is
compatible
with
itself
and
its
welfare
the
state
fixes
for
it
this
limit
as
the
law
of
its
existence
and
of
its
extension
that
one
state
brooks
more
than
another
is
only
a
quantitative
distinction
which
alone
nevertheless
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
political
liberals
they
want
in
germany
for
example
only
a
more
extended
broader
accordance
of
free
utterance

the
liberty
of
the
press
which
is
sought
for
is
an
affair
of
the
people
s
and
before
the
people
the
state
possesses
it
i
may
make
no
use
of
it
from
the
stand
point
of
property
in
the
press
the
situation
is
different
let
my
people
if
they
will
go
without
liberty
of
free
press
i
will
manage
to
print
by
force
or
ruse
i
get
my
permission
to
print
only
from
q
myself
and
my
strength
if
the
press
is
my
own
i
as
little
need
a
permission
of
the
state
for
employing
it
as
i
seek
that
permission
in
order
to
blow
my
nose
the
press
is
my
property
from
the
moment
when
nothing
is
more
to
me
than
myself
for
from
this
moment
state
church
people
society
and
the
like
cease
because
they
have
to
thank
for
their
existence
only
the
disrespect
that
i
have
for
myself
and
with
the
vanishing
of
this
undervaluation
they
themselves
are
extinguished
they
exist
only
when
they
exist
above
me
exist
only
as
powers
and
power
holders
or
can
you
imagine
a
state
whose
citizens
one
and
all
think
nothing
of
it
it
would
be
as
certainly
a
dream
an
existence
in
seeming
as
united
germany

the
press
is
my
own
as
soon
as
i
myself
am
my
own
a
self
owned
man
to
the
egoist
belongs
the
world
because
he
belongs
to
no
power
of
the
world
with
this
my
press
might
still
be
very
unfree
as
at
this
moment
but
the
world
is
large
and
one
helps
himself
as
well
as
he
can
if
i
were
willing
to
abate
from
the
property
of
my
press
i
could
easily
attain
the
point
where
i
might
everywhere
have
as
much
printed
as
my
fingers
produced
but
as
i
want
to
assert
my
property
i
must
necessarily
swindle
my
enemies
would
you
not
accept
their
permission
if
it
were
given
you

certainly
with
joy
for
their
permission
would
be
to
me
a
proof
that
i
had
fooled
them
and
started
them
on
the
road
to
ruin
i
am
not
concerned
for
their
permission
but
so
much
the
more
for
their
folly
and
their
overthrow
i
do
not
sue
for
their
permission
as
if
i
flattered
myself
like
the
political
liberals
that
we
both
they
and
i
could
make
out
peaceably
alongside
and
with
each
other
yes
probably
raise
and
prop
each
other
but
i
sue
for
it
in
order
to
make
them
bleed
to
death
by
it
that
the
permitters
themselves
may
cease
at
last
i
act
as
a
conscious
enemy
overreaching
them
and
utilizing
their
heedlessness
the
press
is
mine
when
i
recognize
outside
myself
no
judge
whatever
over
its
utilization
when
my
writing
is
no
longer
determined
by
morality
or
religion
or
respect
for
the
state
laws
or
the
like
but
by
me
and
my
egoism
now
what
have
you
to
reply
to
him
who
gives
you
so
impudent
an
answer
q
we
shall
perhaps
put
the
question
most
strikingly
by
phrasing
it
as
follows
whose
is
the
press
the
peoples
states
or
mine
the
politicals
on
their
side
intend
nothing
further
than
to
liberate
the
press
from
personal
and
arbitrary
interferences
of
the
possessors
of
power
without
thinking
of
the
point
that
to
be
really
open
for
everybody
it
would
also
have
to
be
free
from
the
laws
from
the
peoples
states
will
they
want
to
make
a
peoples
affair
of
it
but
having
become
the
peoples
property
it
is
still
far
from
being
mine
rather
it
retains
for
me
the
subordinate
significance
of
a
permission
the
people
plays
judge
over
my
thoughts
it
has
the
right
of
calling
me
to
account
for
them
or
i
am
responsible
to
it
for
them
jurors
when
their
fixed
ideas
are
attacked

just
as
hard

as

servile

edgar
bauer
asserts
that
liberty
of
the
press
is
impossible
in
the
absolutist
and
the
constitutional
state
whereas
in
the
free
state
it
finds
its
place
here
the
statement
is
it
is
recognized
that
the
individual
because
he
is
no
longer
an
individual
but
a
member
of
a
true
and
rational
generality
has
the
right
to
utter
his
mind
so
not
the
individual
but
the
member
has
liberty
of
the
press
but
if
for
the
purpose
of
liberty
of
the
press
the
individual
must
first
give
proof
of
himself
regarding
his
belief
in
the
generality
the
people
if
he
does
not
have
this
liberty
through
might
of
his
own
q
then
it
is
a
peoples
liberty
a
liberty
that
he
is
invested
with
for
the
sake
of
his
faith
his
membership
the
reverse
is
the
case
it
is
precisely
as
an
individual
that
every
one
has
open
to
him
the
liberty
to
utter
his
mind
but
he
has
not
the
right
that
liberty
is
assuredly
not
his
sacred
right
he
has
only
the
might
but
the
might
alone
makes
him
owner
i
need
no
concession
for
the
liberty
of
the
press
do
not
need
the
peoples
consent
to
it
do
not
need
the
right
to
it
nor
any
justification
the
liberty
of
the
press
too
like
every
liberty
i
must
take
the
people
as
being
the
sole
judge
cannot
give
it
to
me
it
can
put
up
with
me
the
liberty
that
i
take
or
defend
itself
against
it
give
bestow
grant
it
it
cannot
i
exercise
it
despite
the
people
purely
as
an
individual
i
get
it
by
fighting
the
people
my
q
enemy
and
obtain
it
only
when
i
really
get
it
by
such
fighting
take
it
but
i
take
it
because
it
is
my

sander
against
whom
e
bauer
writes
lays
claim
page

to
the
liberty
of
the
press
as
the
right
and
the
liberty
of
the
citizens
in
the
state
what
else
does
edgar
bauer
do
to
him
also
it
is
only
a
right
of
the
free
citizen
the
liberty
of
the
press
is
also
demanded
under
the
name
of
a
general
human
right
against
this
the
objection
was
well
founded
that
not
every
man
knew
how
to
use
it
rightly
for
not
every
individual
was
truly
man
never
did
a
government
refuse
it
to
man
as
such
but
man
writes
nothing
for
the
reason
that
he
is
a
ghost
it
always
refused
it
to
individuals
only
and
gave
it
to
others
its
organs
if
then
one
would
have
it
for
all
one
must
assert
outright
that
it
is
due
to
the
individual
me
not
to
man
or
to
the
individual
so
far
as
he
is
man
besides
another
than
a
man
a
beast
can
make
no
use
of
it
the
french
government
for
example
does
not
dispute
the
liberty
of
the
press
as
a
right
of
man
but
demands
from
the
individual
a
security
for
his
really
being
man
for
it
assigns
liberty
of
the
press
not
to
the
individual
but
to
man
under
the
exact
pretense
that
it
was
not
human
what
was
mine
was
taken
from
me
what
was
human
was
left
to
me
undiminished
liberty
of
the
press
can
bring
about
only
a
responsible
press
the
irresponsible
proceeds
solely
from
property
in
the
press

for
intercourse
with
men
an
express
law
conformity
to
which
one
may
venture
at
times
sinfully
to
forget
but
the
absolute
value
of
which
one
at
no
time
ventures
to
deny
is
placed
foremost
among
all
who
live
religiously
this
is
the
law
q
of
love
to
which
not
even
those
who
seem
to
fight
against
its
principle
and
who
hate
its
name
have
as
yet
become
untrue
for
they
also
still
have
love
yes
they
love
with
a
deeper
and
more
sublimated
love
they
love
man
and
mankind
if
we
formulate
the
sense
of
this
law
it
will
be
about
as
follows
every
man
must
have
a
something
that
is
more
to
him
than
himself
you
are
to
put
your
private
interest
in
the
background
when
it
is
a
question
of
the
welfare
of
others
the
weal
of
the
fatherland
of
society
the
common
weal
the
weal
of
mankind
the
good
cause
and
the
like
fatherland
society
mankind
must
be
more
to
you
than
yourself
and
as
against
their
interest
your
private
interest
must
stand
back
for
you
must
not
be
an
q
egoist
love
is
a
far
reaching
religious
demand
which
is
not
as
might
be
supposed
limited
to
love
to
god
and
man
but
stands
foremost
in
every
regard
whatever
we
do
think
will
the
ground
of
it
is
always
to
be
love
thus
we
may
indeed
judge
but
only
with
love
the
bible
may
assuredly
be
criticized
and
that
very
thoroughly
but
the
critic
must
before
all
things
love
it
and
see
in
it
the
sacred
book
is
this
anything
else
than
to
say
he
must
not
criticize
it
to
death
he
must
leave
it
standing
and
that
as
a
sacred
thing
that
cannot
be
upset
q
in
our
criticism
on
men
too
love
must
remain
the
unchanged
key
note
certainly
judgments
that
hatred
inspires
are
not
at
all
our
own
judgments
but
judgments
of
the
hatred
that
rules
us
rancorous
judgments
but
are
judgments
that
love
inspires
in
us
any
more
our
own
they
are
judgments
of
the
love
that
rules
us
they
are
loving
lenient
judgments
they
are
not
our
own
and
accordingly
not
real
judgments
at
all
he
who
burns
with
love
for
justice
cries
out
fiat
justitia
pereat
mundus
he
can
doubtless
ask
and
investigate
what
justice
properly
is
or
demands
and
in
what
it
consists
but
not
whether
it
is
anything
it
is
very
true
he
who
abides
in
love
abides
in
god
and
god
in
him

john


god
abides
in
him
he
does
not
get
rid
of
god
does
not
become
godless
and
he
abides
in
god
does
not
come
to
himself
and
into
his
own
home
abides
in
love
to
god
and
does
not
become
loveless
god
is
love
all
times
and
all
races
recognize
in
this
word
the
central
point
of
christianity
god
who
is
love
is
an
officious
god
he
cannot
leave
the
world
in
peace
but
wants
to
make
it
blest
god
became
man
to
make
men
divine

he
has
his
hand
in
the
game
everywhere
and
nothing
happens
without
it
everywhere
he
has
his
best
purposes
his
incomprehensible
plans
and
decrees
reason
which
he
himself
is
is
to
be
forwarded
and
realized
in
the
whole
world
his
fatherly
care
deprives
us
of
all
independence
we
can
do
nothing
sensible
without
its
being
said
god
did
that
and
can
bring
upon
ourselves
no
misfortune
without
hearing
god
ordained
that
we
have
nothing
that
we
have
not
from
him
he
gave
everything
but
as
god
does
so
does
man
god
wants
perforce
to
make
the
world
blest
and
man
wants
to
make
it
happy
to
make
all
men
happy
hence
every
man
wants
to
awaken
in
all
men
the
reason
which
he
supposes
his
own
self
to
have
everything
is
to
be
rational
throughout
god
torments
himself
with
the
devil
and
the
philosopher
does
it
with
unreason
and
the
accidental
god
lets
no
being
go
its
own
gait
and
man
likewise
wants
to
make
us
walk
only
in
human
wise
but
whoso
is
full
of
sacred
religious
moral
humane
love
loves
only
the
spook
the
true
man
and
persecutes
with
dull
mercilessness
the
individual
the
real
man
under
the
phlegmatic
legal
title
of
measures
against
the
un
man
he
finds
it
praiseworthy
and
indispensable
to
exercise
pitilessness
in
the
harshest
measure
for
love
to
the
spook
or
generality
commands
him
to
hate
him
who
is
not
ghostly
the
egoist
or
individual
such
is
the
meaning
of
the
renowned
love
phenomenon
that
is
called
justice
the
criminally
arraigned
man
can
expect
no
forbearance
and
no
one
spreads
a
friendly
veil
over
his
unhappy
nakedness
without
emotion
the
stern
judge
tears
the
last
rags
of
excuse
from
the
body
of
the
poor
accused
without
compassion
the
jailer
drags
him
into
his
damp
abode
without
placability
when
the
time
of
punishment
has
expired
he
thrusts
the
branded
man
again
among
men
his
good
christian
loyal
brethren
who
contemptuously
spit
on
him
yes
without
grace
a
criminal
deserving
of
death
is
led
to
the
scaffold
and
before
the
eyes
of
a
jubilating
crowd
the
appeased
moral
law
celebrates
its
sublime
q
revenge
for
only
one
can
live
the
moral
law
or
the
criminal
where
criminals
live
unpunished
the
moral
law
has
fallen
and
where
this
prevails
those
must
go
down
their
enmity
is
indestructible
the
christian
age
is
precisely
that
of
mercy
love
solicitude
to
have
men
receive
what
is
due
them
yes
to
bring
them
to
fulfil
their
human
divine
calling
therefore
the
principle
has
been
put
foremost
for
intercourse
that
this
and
that
is
mans
essence
and
consequently
his
calling
to
which
either
god
has
called
him
or
according
to
the
concepts
of
today
his
being
man
the
species
calls
him
hence
the
zeal
for
conversion
that
the
communists
and
the
humane
expect
from
man
more
than
the
christians
do
does
not
change
the
stand
point
in
the
least
man
shall
get
what
is
human
if
it
was
enough
for
the
pious
that
what
was
divine
became
his
part
the
humane
demand
that
he
be
not
curtailed
of
what
is
human
both
set
themselves
against
what
is
egoistic
of
course
for
what
is
egoistic
cannot
be
accorded
to
him
or
vested
in
him
a
fief
he
must
procure
it
for
himself
love
imparts
the
former
the
latter
can
be
given
to
me
by
myself
alone
intercourse
hitherto
has
rested
on
love
regardful
behaviour
doing
for
each
other
as
one
owed
it
to
himself
to
make
himself
blessed
or
owed
himself
the
bliss
of
taking
up
into
himself
the
supreme
essence
and
bringing
it
to
a
vrit
a
truth
and
reality
so
one
owed
it
to
others
to
help
them
realize
their
essence
and
their
calling
in
both
cases
one
owed
it
to
the
essence
of
man
to
contribute
to
its
realization
but
one
owes
it
neither
to
himself
to
make
anything
out
of
himself
nor
to
others
to
make
anything
out
of
them
for
one
owes
nothing
to
his
essence
and
that
of
others
intercourse
resting
on
essence
is
an
intercourse
with
the
spook
not
with
anything
real
if
i
hold
intercourse
with
the
supreme
essence
i
am
not
holding
intercourse
with
myself
and
if
i
hold
intercourse
with
the
essence
of
man
i
am
not
holding
intercourse
with
men
the
natural
mans
love
becomes
through
culture
a
commandment
but
as
commandment
it
belongs
to
man
as
such
not
to
me
it
is
my
essence

about
which
much
ado
is
made
not
my
property
man
humanity
presents
that
demand
to
me
love
is
demanded
it
is
my
duty
instead
therefore
of
being
really
won
for
me
it
has
been
won
for
the
generality
man
as
his
property
or
peculiarity
it
becomes
man
every
man
to
love
love
is
the
duty
and
calling
of
man
etc
consequently
i
must
again
vindicate
love
for
myself
and
deliver
it
out
of
the
power
of
man
with
the
great
m
what
was
originally
mine
but
accidentally
mine
instinctively
mine
i
was
invested
with
as
the
property
of
man
i
became
feoffee
in
loving
i
became
the
retainer
of
mankind
only
a
specimen
of
this
species
and
acted
loving
not
as
i
but
as
man
as
a
specimen
of
man
the
humanly
the
whole
condition
of
civilization
is
the
feudal
system
the
property
being
mans
or
mankinds
not
mine
a
monstrous
feudal
state
was
founded
the
individual
robbed
of
everything
everything
left
to
man
the
individual
had
to
appear
at
last
as
a
sinner
through
and
through
am
i
perchance
to
have
no
lively
interest
in
the
person
of
another
are
his
joy
and
his
weal
not
to
lie
at
my
heart
is
the
enjoyment
that
i
furnish
him
not
to
be
more
to
me
than
other
enjoyments
of
my
own
on
the
contrary
i
can
with
joy
sacrifice
to
him
numberless
enjoyments
i
can
deny
myself
numberless
things
for
the
enhancement
of
his
pleasure
and
i
can
hazard
for
him
what
without
him
was
the
dearest
to
me
my
life
my
welfare
my
freedom
why
it
constitutes
my
pleasure
and
my
happiness
to
refresh
myself
with
his
happiness
and
his
pleasure
but
myself
my
own
self
i
do
not
sacrifice
to
him
but
remain
an
egoist
and
enjoy
him
if
i
sacrifice
to
him
everything
that
but
for
my
love
to
him
i
should
keep
that
is
very
simple
and
even
more
usual
in
life
than
it
seems
to
be
but
it
proves
nothing
further
than
that
this
one
passion
is
more
powerful
in
me
than
all
the
rest
christianity
too
teaches
us
to
sacrifice
all
other
passions
to
this
but
if
to
one
passion
i
sacrifice
others
i
do
not
on
that
account
go
so
far
as
to
sacrifice
myself
nor
sacrifice
anything
of
that
whereby
i
truly
am
myself
i
do
not
sacrifice
my
peculiar
value
my
ownness
where
this
bad
case
occurs
love
cuts
no
better
figure
than
any
other
passion
that
i
obey
blindly
the
ambitious
man
who
is
carried
away
by
ambition
and
remains
deaf
to
every
warning
that
a
calm
moment
begets
in
him
has
let
this
passion
grow
up
into
a
despot
against
whom
he
abandons
all
power
of
dissolution
he
has
given
up
himself
because
he
cannot
dissolve
himself
and
consequently
cannot
absolve
himself
from
the
passion
he
is
possessed
i
love
men
too
q
not
merely
individuals
but
every
one
but
i
love
them
with
the
consciousness
of
egoism
i
love
them
because
love
makes
me
happy
i
love
because
loving
is
natural
to
me
because
it
pleases
me
i
know
no
commandment
of
love
i
have
a
fellow
feeling
with
every
feeling
being
and
their
torment
torments
their
refreshment
refreshes
me
too
i
can
kill
them
not
torture
them
per
contra
the
high
souled
virtuous
philistine
prince
rudolph
in
the
mysteries
of
paris

because
the
wicked
provoke
his
indignation
plans
their
torture
that
fellow
feeling
proves
only
that
the
feeling
of
those
who
feel
is
mine
too
my
property
in
opposition
to
which
the
pitiless
dealing
of
the
righteous
man
as
against
notary
ferrand
is
like
the
unfeelingness
of
that
robber
procrustes
who
cut
off
or
stretched
his
prisoners
legs
to
the
measure
of
his
bedstead
rudolphs
bedstead
which
he
cuts
men
to
fit
is
the
concept
of
the
good
the
for
right
virtue
etc
makes
people
hard
hearted
and
intolerant
rudolph
does
not
feel
like
the
notary
but
the
reverse
he
feels
that
it
serves
the
rascal
right
that
is
no
fellow
feeling
you
love
man
therefore
you
torture
the
individual
man
the
egoist
your
philanthropy
love
of
men
is
the
tormenting
of
men
if
i
see
the
loved
one
suffer
i
suffer
with
him
and
i
know
no
rest
till
i
have
tried
everything
to
comfort
and
cheer
him
if
i
see
him
glad
i
too
become
glad
over
his
joy
from
this
it
does
not
follow
that
suffering
or
joy
is
caused
in
me
by
the
same
thing
that
brings
out
this
effect
in
him
as
is
sufficiently
proved
by
every
bodily
pain
which
i
do
not
feel
as
he
does
his
tooth
pains
him
but
his
pain
pains
me
but
because
i
cannot
bear
the
troubled
crease
on
the
beloved
forehead
for
that
reason
and
therefore
for
my
sake
i
kiss
it
away
if
i
did
not
love
this
person
he
might
go
right
on
making
creases
they
would
not
trouble
me
i
am
only
driving
away
my
trouble
how
now
has
anybody
or
anything
whom
and
which
i
do
not
love
a
right
to
be
loved
by
me
is
my
love
first
or
is
his
right
first
parents
kinsfolk
fatherland
nation
native
town
etc
finally
fellowmen
in
general
brothers
fraternity
assert
that
they
have
a
right
to
my
love
and
lay
claim
to
it
without
further
ceremony
they
look
upon
it
as
their
property
and
upon
me
if
i
do
not
respect
this
as
a
robber
who
takes
from
them
what
pertains
to
them
and
is
theirs
i
should
love
if
love
is
a
commandment
and
law
then
i
must
be
educated
into
it
cultivated
up
to
it
and
if
i
trespass
against
it
punished
hence
people
will
exercise
as
strong
a
moral
influence
as
possible
on
me
to
bring
me
to
love
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
one
can
work
up
and
seduce
men
to
love
as
one
can
to
other
passions
q
if
you
like
to
hate
hate
runs
through
whole
races
merely
because
the
ancestors
of
the
one
belonged
to
the
guelphs
those
of
the
other
to
the
ghibellines
but
love
is
not
a
commandment
but
like
each
of
my
feelings
my
property
acquire
purchase
my
property
and
then
i
will
make
it
over
to
you
a
church
a
nation
a
fatherland
a
family
etc
that
does
not
know
how
to
acquire
my
love
i
need
not
love
and
i
fix
the
purchase
price
of
my
love
quite
at
my
pleasure
selfish
love
is
far
distant
from
unselfish
mystical
or
romantic
love
one
can
love
everything
possible
not
merely
men
but
an
object
in
general
wine
ones
fatherland
etc
love
becomes
blind
and
crazy
by
a
must
taking
it
out
of
my
power
infatuation
romantic
by
a
should
entering
into
it
by
the
objects
becoming
sacred
for
me
or
my
becoming
bound
to
it
by
duty
conscience
oath
now
the
object
no
longer
exists
for
me
but
i
for
it
love
is
a
possessedness
not
as
my
feeling
q
as
such
i
rather
keep
it
in
my
possession
as
property
q
but
through
the
alienness
of
the
object
for
religious
love
consists
in
the
commandment
to
love
in
the
beloved
a
holy
one
or
to
adhere
to
a
holy
one
for
unselfish
love
there
are
objects
absolutely
lovable
for
which
my
heart
is
to
beat
such
as
fellow
men
or
my
wedded
mate
kinsfolk
etc
holy
love
loves
the
holy
in
the
beloved
and
therefore
exerts
itself
also
to
make
of
the
beloved
more
and
more
a
holy
one
a
man
the
beloved
is
an
object
that
should
be
loved
by
me
he
is
not
an
object
of
my
love
on
account
of
because
of
or
by
my
loving
him
but
is
an
object
of
love
in
and
of
himself
not
i
make
him
an
object
of
love
but
he
is
such
to
begin
with
for
it
is
here
irrelevant
that
he
has
become
so
by
my
choice
if
so
it
be
as
with
a
fiance
a
spouse
and
the
like
since
even
so
he
has
in
any
case
as
the
person
once
chosen
obtained
a
right
of
his
own
to
my
love
and
i
because
i
have
loved
him
am
under
obligation
to
love
him
forever
he
is
therefore
not
an
object
of
my
love
but
of
love
in
general
an
object
that
should
be
loved
love
appertains
to
him
is
due
to
him
or
is
his
right
while
i
am
under
obligation
to
love
him
my
love
the
toll
of
love
that
i
pay
him
is
in
truth
his
love
which
he
only
collects
from
me
as
toll
every
love
to
which
there
clings
but
the
smallest
speck
of
obligation
is
an
unselfish
love
and
so
far
as
this
speck
reaches
a
possessedness
he
who
believes
that
he
owes
the
object
of
his
love
anything
loves
romantically
or
religiously
family
love
as
it
is
usually
understood
as
piety
is
a
religious
love
love
of
fatherland
preached
as
patriotism
likewise
all
our
romantic
loves
move
in
the
same
pattern
everywhere
the
hypocrisy
or
rather
self
deception
of
an
unselfish
love
an
interest
in
the
object
for
the
objects
sake
not
for
my
sake
and
mine
alone
religious
or
romantic
love
is
distinguished
from
sensual
love
by
the
difference
of
the
object
indeed
but
not
by
the
dependence
of
the
relation
to
it
in
the
latter
regard
both
are
possessedness
but
in
the
former
the
one
object
is
profane
the
other
sacred
the
dominion
of
the
object
over
me
is
the
same
in
both
cases
only
that
it
is
one
time
a
sensuous
one
the
other
time
a
spiritual
ghostly
one
my
love
is
my
own
only
when
it
consists
altogether
in
a
selfish
and
egoistic
interest
and
when
consequently
the
object
of
my
love
is
really
my
object
or
my
property
i
owe
my
property
nothing
and
have
no
duty
to
it
as
little
as
i
might
have
a
duty
to
my
eye
if
nevertheless
i
guard
it
with
the
greatest
care
i
do
so
on
my
account
antiquity
lacked
love
as
little
as
do
christian
times
the
god
of
love
is
older
than
the
god
of
love
but
the
mystical
possessedness
belongs
to
the
moderns
the
possessedness
of
love
lies
in
the
alienation
of
the
object
or
in
my
powerlessness
as
against
its
alienness
and
superior
power
to
the
egoist
nothing
is
high
enough
for
him
to
humble
himself
before
it
nothing
so
independent
that
he
would
live
for
love
of
it
nothing
so
sacred
that
he
would
sacrifice
himself
to
it
the
egoists
love
rises
in
selfishness
flows
in
the
bed
of
selfishness
and
empties
into
selfishness
again
whether
this
can
still
be
called
love
if
you
know
another
word
for
it
go
ahead
and
choose
it
then
the
sweet
word
love
may
wither
with
the
departed
world
for
the
present
i
at
least
find
none
in
our
christian
language
and
hence
stick
to
the
old
sound
and
love
my
object
my
q
property
only
as
one
of
my
feelings
do
i
harbour
love
but
as
a
power
above
me
as
a
divine
power
as
feuerbach
says
as
a
passion
that
i
am
not
to
cast
off
as
a
religious
and
moral
duty
i
q
scorn
it
as
my
feeling
it
is
mine
as
a
principle
to
which
i
consecrate
and
vow
my
soul
it
is
a
dominator
and
divine
just
as
hatred
as
a
principle
is
diabolical
one
not
better
than
the
other
in
short
egoistic
love
my
love
is
neither
holy
nor
unholy
neither
divine
nor
diabolical
a
love
that
is
limited
by
faith
is
an
untrue
love
the
sole
limitation
that
does
not
contradict
the
essence
of
love
is
the
self
limitation
of
love
by
reason
intelligence
love
that
scorns
the
rigour
the
law
of
intelligence
is
theoretically
a
false
love
practically
a
ruinous
one

so
love
is
in
its
essence
rational
so
thinks
feuerbach
the
believer
on
the
contrary
thinks
love
is
in
its
essence
believing
the
one
inveighs
against
irrational
the
other
against
unbelieving
love
to
both
it
can
at
most
rank
as
a
splendidum
vitium
do
not
both
leave
love
standing
even
in
the
form
of
unreason
and
unbelief
they
do
not
dare
to
say
irrational
or
unbelieving
love
is
nonsense
is
not
love
as
little
as
they
are
willing
to
say
irrational
or
unbelieving
tears
are
not
tears
but
if
even
irrational
love
etc
must
count
as
love
and
if
they
are
nevertheless
to
be
unworthy
of
man
there
follows
simply
this
love
is
not
the
highest
thing
but
reason
or
faith
even
the
unreasonable
and
the
unbelieving
can
love
but
love
has
value
only
when
it
is
that
of
a
rational
or
believing
person
it
is
an
illusion
when
feuerbach
calls
the
rationality
of
love
its
self
limitation
the
believer
might
with
the
same
right
call
belief
its
self
limitation
irrational
love
is
neither
false
nor
ruinous
its
does
its
service
as
love
toward
the
world
especially
toward
men
i
am
to
assume
a
particular
feeling
and
meet
them
with
love
with
the
feeling
of
love
from
the
beginning
certainly
in
this
there
is
revealed
far
more
free
will
and
self
determination
than
when
i
let
myself
be
stormed
by
way
of
the
world
by
all
possible
feelings
and
remain
exposed
to
the
most
checkered
most
accidental
impressions
i
go
to
the
world
rather
with
a
preconceived
feeling
as
if
it
were
a
prejudice
and
a
preconceived
opinion
i
have
prescribed
to
myself
in
advance
my
behaviour
toward
it
and
despite
all
its
temptations
feel
and
think
about
it
only
as
i
have
once
determined
to
against
the
dominion
of
the
world
i
secure
myself
by
the
principle
of
love
for
whatever
may
come
i
q
love
the
ugly
for
example
makes
a
repulsive
impression
on
me
but
determined
to
love
i
master
this
impression
as
i
do
every
antipathy
but
the
feeling
to
which
i
have
determined
and
q
condemned
myself
from
the
start
is
a
narrow
feeling
because
it
is
a
predestined
one
of
which
i
myself
am
not
able
to
get
clear
or
to
declare
myself
clear
because
preconceived
it
is
a
prejudice
i
no
longer
show
myself
in
face
of
the
world
but
my
love
shows
itself
the
world
indeed
does
not
rule
me
but
so
much
the
more
inevitably
does
the
spirit
of
love
rule
this
spirit
if
i
first
said
i
love
the
world
i
now
add
likewise
i
do
not
love
it
for
i
annihilate
it
as
i
annihilate
myself
i
dissolve
it
i
do
not
limit
myself
to
one
feeling
for
men
but
give
free
play
to
all
that
i
am
capable
of
why
should
i
not
dare
speak
it
out
in
all
its
glaringness
yes
i
utilize
the
world
and
men
with
this
i
can
keep
myself
open
to
every
impression
without
being
torn
away
from
myself
by
one
of
them
i
can
love
love
with
a
full
heart
and
let
the
most
consuming
glow
of
passion
burn
in
my
heart
without
taking
the
beloved
one
for
anything
else
than
the
nourishment
of
my
passion
on
which
it
ever
refreshes
itself
anew
all
my
care
for
him
applies
only
to
the
object
of
my
love
only
to
him
whom
my
love
requires
only
to
him
the
warmly
loved
how
indifferent
would
he
be
to
me
without
this
q
my
love
i
feed
only
my
love
with
him
i
utilize
him
for
this
only
i
enjoy
him
let
us
choose
another
convenient
example
i
see
how
men
are
fretted
in
dark
superstition
by
a
swarm
of
ghosts
if
to
the
extent
of
my
powers
i
let
a
bit
of
daylight
fall
in
on
the
nocturnal
spookery
is
it
perchance
because
love
to
you
inspires
this
in
me
do
i
write
out
of
love
to
men
no
i
write
because
i
want
to
procure
for
my
thoughts
an
existence
in
the
world
and
even
if
i
foresaw
that
these
thoughts
would
deprive
you
of
your
rest
and
your
peace
even
if
i
saw
the
bloodiest
wars
and
the
fall
of
many
generations
springing
up
from
this
seed
of
thought
q
i
would
nevertheless
scatter
it
do
with
it
what
you
will
and
can
that
is
your
affair
and
does
not
trouble
me
you
will
perhaps
have
only
trouble
combat
and
death
from
it
very
few
will
draw
joy
from
it
if
your
weal
lay
at
my
heart
i
should
act
as
the
church
did
in
withholding
the
bible
from
the
laity
or
christian
governments
which
make
it
a
sacred
duty
for
themselves
to
protect
the
common
people
from
bad
books
but
not
only
not
for
your
sake
not
even
for
truths
sake
either
do
i
speak
out
what
i
think
no
q
i
sing
as
the
bird
sings
that
on
the
bough
alights
the
song
that
from
me
springs
is
pay
that
well
requites
i
sing
because
q
i
am
a
singer
but
i
use
you
for
it
because
i
q
need
ears
where
the
world
comes
in
my
way
q
and
it
comes
in
my
way
everywhere
q
i
consume
it
to
quiet
the
hunger
of
my
egoism
for
me
you
are
nothing
but
q
my
food
even
as
i
too
am
fed
upon
and
turned
to
use
by
you
we
have
only
one
relation
to
each
other
that
of
usableness
of
utility
of
use
we
owe
each
other
nothing
for
what
i
seem
to
owe
you
i
owe
at
most
to
myself
if
i
show
you
a
cheery
air
in
order
to
cheer
you
likewise
then
your
cheeriness
is
of
consequence
to
me
and
my
air
serves
my
wish
to
a
thousand
others
whom
i
do
not
aim
to
cheer
i
do
not
show
it

one
has
to
be
educated
up
to
that
love
which
founds
itself
on
the
essence
of
man
or
in
the
ecclesiastical
and
moral
period
lies
upon
us
as
a
commandment
in
what
fashion
moral
influence
the
chief
ingredient
of
our
education
seeks
to
regulate
the
intercourse
of
men
shall
here
be
looked
at
with
egoistic
eyes
in
one
example
at
least
those
who
educate
us
make
it
their
concern
early
to
break
us
of
lying
and
to
inculcate
the
principle
that
one
must
always
tell
the
truth
if
selfishness
were
made
the
basis
for
this
rule
every
one
would
easily
understand
how
by
lying
he
fools
away
that
confidence
in
him
which
he
hopes
to
awaken
in
others
and
how
correct
the
maxim
proves
nobody
believes
a
liar
even
when
he
tells
the
truth
yet
at
the
same
time
he
would
also
feel
that
he
had
to
meet
with
truth
only
him
whom
he
authorized
to
hear
the
truth
if
a
spy
walks
in
disguise
through
the
hostile
camp
and
is
asked
who
he
is
the
askers
are
assuredly
entitled
to
inquire
after
his
name
but
the
disguised
man
does
not
give
them
the
right
to
learn
the
truth
from
him
he
tells
them
what
he
likes
only
not
the
fact
and
yet
morality
demands
thou
shalt
not
lie
by
morality
those
persons
are
vested
with
the
right
to
expect
the
truth
but
by
me
they
are
not
vested
with
that
right
and
i
recognize
only
the
right
that
i
impart
in
a
gathering
of
revolutionists
the
police
force
their
way
in
and
ask
the
orator
for
his
name
everybody
knows
that
the
police
have
the
right
to
do
so
but
they
do
not
have
it
from
the
revolutionist
since
he
is
their
enemy
he
tells
them
a
false
name
and
q
cheats
them
with
a
lie
the
police
do
not
act
so
foolishly
either
as
to
count
on
their
enemies
love
of
truth
on
the
contrary
they
do
not
believe
without
further
ceremony
but
have
the
questioned
individual
identified
if
they
can
nay
the
state
everywhere
proceeds
incredulously
with
individuals
because
in
their
egoism
it
recognizes
its
natural
enemy
it
invariably
demands
a
voucher
and
he
who
cannot
show
vouchers
falls
a
prey
to
its
investigating
inquisition
the
state
does
not
believe
nor
trust
the
individual
and
so
of
itself
places
itself
with
him
in
the
convention
of
lying
it
trusts
me
only
when
it
has
convinced
itself
of
the
truth
of
my
statement
for
which
there
often
remains
to
it
no
other
means
than
the
oath
how
clearly
too
this
the
oath
proves
that
the
state
does
not
count
on
our
credibility
and
love
of
truth
but
on
our
interest
our
selfishness
it
relies
on
our
not
wanting
to
fall
foul
of
god
by
a
perjury
now
let
one
imagine
a
french
revolutionist
in
the
year

who
among
friends
let
fall
the
now
well
known
phrase
the
world
will
have
no
rest
till
the
last
king
is
hanged
with
the
guts
of
the
last
priest
the
king
then
still
had
all
power
and
when
the
utterance
is
betrayed
by
an
accident
yet
without
its
being
possible
to
produce
witnesses
confession
is
demanded
from
the
accused
is
he
to
confess
or
not
if
he
denies
he
lies
and
q
remains
unpunished
if
he
confesses
he
is
candid
and
q
is
beheaded
if
truth
is
more
than
everything
else
to
him
all
right
let
him
die
only
a
paltry
poet
could
try
to
make
a
tragedy
out
of
the
end
of
his
life
for
what
interest
is
there
in
seeing
how
a
man
succumbs
from
cowardice
but
if
he
had
the
courage
not
to
be
a
slave
of
truth
and
sincerity
he
would
ask
somewhat
thus
why
need
the
judges
know
what
i
have
spoken
among
friends
if
i
had
wished
them
to
know
i
should
have
said
it
to
them
as
i
said
it
to
my
friends
i
will
not
have
them
know
it
they
force
themselves
into
my
confidence
without
my
having
called
them
to
it
and
made
them
my
confidants
they
will
learn
what
i
will
keep
secret
come
on
then
you
who
wish
to
break
my
will
by
your
will
and
try
your
arts
you
can
torture
me
by
the
rack
you
can
threaten
me
with
hell
and
eternal
damnation
you
can
make
me
so
nerveless
that
i
swear
a
false
oath
but
the
truth
you
shall
not
press
out
of
me
for
i
will
lie
to
you
because
i
have
given
you
no
claim
and
no
right
to
my
sincerity
let
god
who
is
truth
look
down
ever
so
threateningly
on
me
let
lying
come
ever
so
hard
to
me
i
have
nevertheless
the
courage
of
a
lie
and
even
if
i
were
weary
of
my
life
even
if
nothing
appeared
to
me
more
welcome
than
your
executioners
sword
you
nevertheless
should
not
have
the
joy
of
finding
in
me
a
slave
of
truth
whom
by
your
priestly
arts
you
make
a
traitor
to
his
will
when
i
spoke
those
treasonable
words
i
would
not
have
had
you
know
anything
of
them
i
now
retain
the
same
will
and
do
not
let
myself
be
frightened
by
the
curse
of
the
lie
sigismund
is
not
a
miserable
caitiff
because
he
broke
his
princely
word

but
he
broke
the
word
because
he
was
a
caitiff
he
might
have
kept
his
word
and
would
still
have
been
a
caitiff
a
priest
ridden
man
luther
driven
by
a
higher
power
became
unfaithful
to
his
monastic
vow
he
became
so
for
gods
sake
both
broke
their
oath
as
possessed
persons
sigismund
because
he
wanted
to
appear
as
a
sincere
professor
of
the
divine
truth
that
is
of
the
true
genuinely
catholic
faith
luther
in
order
to
give
testimony
for
the
gospel
sincerely
and
with
entire
truth
with
body
and
soul
both
became
perjured
in
order
to
be
sincere
toward
the
higher
truth
only
the
priests
absolved
the
one
the
other
absolved
himself
what
else
did
both
observe
than
what
is
contained
in
those
apostolic
words
thou
hast
not
lied
to
men
but
to
god
they
lied
to
men
broke
their
oath
before
the
worlds
eyes
in
order
not
to
lie
to
god
but
to
serve
him
thus
they
show
us
a
way
to
deal
with
truth
before
men
for
gods
glory
and
for
gods
sake
a
q
breach
of
oath
a
lie
a
princes
word
broken
how
would
it
be
now
if
we
changed
the
thing
a
little
and
wrote
a
perjury
and
lie
for
q
my
sake
would
not
that
be
pleading
for
every
baseness
it
seems
so
assuredly
only
in
this
it
is
altogether
like
the
for
gods
sake
for
was
not
every
baseness
committed
for
gods
sake
were
not
all
the
scaffolds
filled
for
his
sake
and
all
the
autos
da
f
held
for
his
sake
was
not
all
stupefaction
introduced
for
his
sake
and
do
they
not
today
still
for
gods
sake
fetter
the
mind
in
tender
children
by
religious
education
were
not
sacred
vows
broken
for
his
sake
and
do
not
missionaries
and
priests
still
go
around
every
day
to
bring
jews
heathen
protestants
or
catholics
to
treason
against
the
faith
of
their
fathers
q
for
his
sake
and
that
should
be
worse
with
the
for
my
sake
what
then
does
on
my
account
mean
there
people
immediately
think
of
filthy
lucre
but
he
who
acts
from
love
of
filthy
lucre
does
it
on
his
own
account
indeed
as
there
is
nothing
anyhow
that
one
does
not
do
for
his
own
sake
q
among
other
things
everything
that
is
done
for
gods
glory
yet
he
for
whom
he
seeks
the
lucre
is
a
slave
of
lucre
not
raised
above
lucre
he
is
one
who
belongs
to
lucre
the
money
bag
not
to
himself
he
is
not
his
own
must
not
a
man
whom
the
passion
of
avarice
rules
follow
the
commands
of
this
master
and
if
a
weak
goodnaturedness
once
beguiles
him
does
this
not
appear
as
simply
an
exceptional
case
of
precisely
the
same
sort
as
when
pious
believers
are
sometimes
forsaken
by
their
lords
guidance
and
ensnared
by
the
arts
of
the
devil
so
an
avaricious
man
is
not
a
self
owned
man
but
a
servant
and
he
can
do
nothing
for
his
own
sake
without
at
the
same
time
doing
it
for
his
lords
sake
precisely
like
the
godly
man
famous
is
the
breach
of
oath
which
francis
i
committed
against
emperor
charles
v

not
later
when
he
ripely
weighed
his
promise
but
at
once
when
he
swore
the
oath
king
francis
took
it
back
in
thought
as
well
as
by
a
secret
protestation
documentarily
subscribed
before
his
councillors
he
uttered
a
perjury
afore
thought
francis
did
not
show
himself
disinclined
to
buy
his
release
but
the
price
that
charles
put
on
it
seemed
to
him
too
high
and
unreasonable
even
though
charles
behaved
himself
in
a
sordid
fashion
when
he
sought
to
extort
as
much
as
possible
it
was
yet
shabby
of
francis
to
want
to
purchase
his
freedom
for
a
lower
ransom
and
his
later
dealings
among
which
there
occurs
yet
a
second
breach
of
his
word
prove
sufficiently
how
the
huckster
spirit
held
him
enthralled
and
made
him
a
shabby
swindler
however
what
shall
we
say
to
the
reproach
of
perjury
against
him
in
the
first
place
surely
this
again
that
not
the
perjury
but
his
sordidness
shamed
him
that
he
did
not
deserve
contempt
for
his
perjury
but
made
himself
guilty
of
perjury
because
he
was
a
contemptible
man
but
franciss
perjury
regarded
in
itself
demands
another
judgment
one
might
say
francis
did
not
respond
to
the
confidence
that
charles
put
in
him
in
setting
him
free
but
if
charles
had
really
favoured
him
with
confidence
he
would
have
named
to
him
the
price
that
he
considered
the
release
worth
and
would
then
have
set
him
at
liberty
and
expected
francis
to
pay
the
redemption
sum
charles
harboured
no
such
trust
but
only
believed
in
franciss
impotence
and
credulity
which
would
not
allow
him
to
act
against
his
oath
but
francis
deceived
only
this
q
credulous
calculation
when
charles
believed
he
was
assuring
himself
of
his
enemy
by
an
oath
right
there
he
was
freeing
him
from
every
obligation
charles
had
given
the
king
credit
for
a
piece
of
stupidity
a
narrow
conscience
and
without
confidence
in
francis
counted
only
on
franciss
stupidity
that
is
conscientiousness
he
let
him
go
from
the
madrid
prison
only
to
hold
him
the
more
securely
in
the
prison
of
conscientiousness
the
great
jail
built
about
the
mind
of
man
by
religion
he
sent
him
back
to
france
locked
fast
in
invisible
chains
what
wonder
if
francis
sought
to
escape
and
sawed
the
chains
apart
no
man
would
have
taken
it
amiss
of
him
if
he
had
secretly
fled
from
madrid
for
he
was
in
an
enemys
power
but
every
good
christian
cries
out
upon
him
that
he
wanted
to
loose
himself
from
gods
bonds
too
it
was
only
later
that
the
pope
absolved
him
from
his
oath
it
is
despicable
to
deceive
a
confidence
that
we
voluntarily
call
forth
but
it
is
no
shame
to
egoism
to
let
every
one
who
wants
to
get
us
into
his
power
by
an
oath
bleed
to
death
by
the
unsuccessfulness
of
his
untrustful
craft
if
you
have
wanted
to
bind
me
then
learn
that
i
know
how
to
burst
your
bonds
the
point
is
whether
i
give
the
confider
the
right
to
confidence
if
the
pursuer
of
my
friend
asks
me
where
he
has
fled
to
i
shall
surely
put
him
on
a
false
trail
why
does
he
ask
precisely
me
the
pursued
mans
friend
in
order
not
to
be
a
false
traitorous
friend
i
prefer
to
be
false
to
the
enemy
i
might
certainly
in
courageous
conscientiousness
answer
i
will
not
tell
so
fichte
decides
the
case
by
that
i
should
salve
my
love
of
truth
and
do
for
my
friend
as
much
as
q
nothing
for
if
i
do
not
mislead
the
enemy
he
may
accidentally
take
the
right
street
and
my
love
of
truth
would
have
given
up
my
friend
as
a
prey
because
it
hindered
me
from
the
q
courage
for
a
lie
he
who
has
in
the
truth
an
idol
a
sacred
thing
must
humble
himself
before
it
must
not
defy
its
demands
not
resist
courageously
in
short
he
must
renounce
the
heroism
of
the
lie
for
to
the
lie
belongs
not
less
courage
than
to
the
truth
a
courage
that
young
men
are
most
apt
to
be
defective
in
who
would
rather
confess
the
truth
and
mount
the
scaffold
for
it
than
confound
the
enemys
power
by
the
impudence
of
a
lie
to
them
the
truth
is
sacred
and
the
sacred
at
all
times
demands
blind
reverence
submission
and
self
sacrifice
if
you
are
not
impudent
not
mockers
of
the
sacred
you
are
tame
and
its
servants
let
one
but
lay
a
grain
of
truth
in
the
trap
for
you
you
peck
at
it
to
a
certainty
and
the
fool
is
caught
you
will
not
lie
well
then
fall
as
sacrifices
to
the
truth
and
become
q
martyrs
martyrs
q
for
what
for
yourselves
for
self
ownership
no
for
your
goddess
q
the
truth
you
know
only
two
services
only
two
kinds
of
servants
servants
of
the
truth
and
servants
of
the
lie
then
in
gods
name
serve
the
truth
others
again
serve
the
truth
also
but
they
serve
it
in
moderation
and
make
a
great
distinction
between
a
simple
lie
and
a
lie
sworn
to
and
yet
the
whole
chapter
of
the
oath
coincides
with
that
of
the
lie
since
an
oath
everybody
knows
is
only
a
strongly
assured
statement
you
consider
yourselves
entitled
to
lie
if
only
you
do
not
swear
to
it
besides
one
who
is
particular
about
it
must
judge
and
condemn
a
lie
as
sharply
as
a
false
oath
but
now
there
has
been
kept
up
in
morality
an
ancient
point
of
controversy
which
is
customarily
treated
of
under
the
name
of
the
lie
of
necessity
no
one
who
dares
plead
for
this
can
consistently
put
from
him
an
oath
of
necessity
if
i
justify
my
lie
as
a
lie
of
necessity
i
should
not
be
so
pusillanimous
as
to
rob
the
justified
lie
of
the
strongest
corroboration
whatever
i
do
why
should
i
not
do
it
entirely
and
without
reservations
reservatio
mentalis
if
i
once
lie
why
then
not
lie
completely
with
entire
consciousness
and
all
my
might
as
a
spy
i
should
have
to
swear
to
each
of
my
false
statements
at
the
enemys
demand
determined
to
lie
to
him
should
i
suddenly
become
cowardly
and
undecided
in
face
of
an
oath
then
i
should
have
been
ruined
in
advance
for
a
liar
and
spy
for
you
see
i
should
be
voluntarily
putting
into
the
enemys
hands
a
means
to
catch
me
q
the
state
too
fears
the
oath
of
necessity
and
for
this
reason
does
not
give
the
accused
a
chance
to
swear
but
you
do
not
justify
the
states
fear
you
lie
but
do
not
swear
falsely
if
you
show
some
one
a
kindness
and
he
is
not
to
know
it
but
he
guesses
it
and
tells
you
so
to
your
face
you
deny
if
he
insists
you
say
honestly
no
if
it
came
to
swearing
then
you
would
refuse
for
from
fear
of
the
sacred
you
always
stop
half
way
against
the
sacred
you
have
no
will
of
your
own
you
lie
in
q
moderation
as
you
are
free
in
moderation
religious
in
moderation
the
clergy
are
not
to
encroach
over
this
point
the
most
rapid
of
controversies
is
now
being
carried
on
on
the
part
of
the
university
against
the
church
monarchically
disposed
in
moderation
you
want
a
monarch
limited
by
the
constitution
by
a
fundamental
law
of
the
state
everything
nicely
tempered
lukewarm
half
gods
half
the
devils
there
was
a
university
where
the
usage
was
that
every
word
of
honour
that
must
be
given
to
the
university
judge
was
looked
upon
by
the
students
as
null
and
void
for
the
students
saw
in
the
demanding
of
it
nothing
but
a
snare
which
they
could
not
escape
otherwise
than
by
taking
away
all
its
significance
he
who
at
that
same
university
broke
his
word
of
honour
to
one
of
the
fellows
was
infamous
he
who
gave
it
to
the
university
judge
derided
in
union
with
these
very
fellows
the
dupe
who
fancied
that
a
word
had
the
same
value
among
friends
and
among
foes
it
was
less
a
correct
theory
than
the
constraint
of
practice
that
had
there
taught
the
students
to
act
so
as
without
that
means
of
getting
out
they
would
have
been
pitilessly
driven
to
treachery
against
their
comrades
but
as
the
means
approved
itself
in
practice
so
it
has
its
theoretical
probation
too
a
word
of
honour
an
oath
is
one
only
for
him
whom
i
entitle
to
receive
it
he
who
forces
me
to
it
obtains
only
a
forced
a
hostile
word
the
word
of
a
foe
whom
one
has
no
right
to
trust
for
the
foe
does
not
give
us
the
right
aside
from
this
the
courts
of
the
state
do
not
even
recognize
the
inviolability
of
an
oath
for
if
i
had
sworn
to
one
who
comes
under
examination
that
i
would
not
declare
anything
against
him
the
court
would
demand
my
declaration
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
an
oath
binds
me
and
in
case
of
refusal
would
lock
me
up
till
i
decided
to
become
q
an
oath
breaker
the
court
absolves
me
from
my
oath
q
how
magnanimous
if
any
power
can
absolve
me
from
the
oath
i
myself
am
surely
the
very
first
power
that
has
a
claim
to
as
a
curiosity
and
to
remind
us
of
customary
oaths
of
all
sorts
let
place
be
given
here
to
that
which
emperor
paul
commanded
the
captured
poles
kosciuszko
potocki
niemcewicz
and
others
to
take
when
he
released
them
we
not
merely
swear
fidelity
and
obedience
to
the
emperor
but
also
further
promise
to
pour
out
our
blood
for
his
glory
we
obligate
ourselves
to
discover
everything
threatening
to
his
person
or
his
empire
that
we
ever
learn
we
declare
finally
that
in
whatever
part
of
the
earth
we
may
be
a
single
word
of
the
emperor
shall
suffice
to
make
us
leave
everything
and
repair
to
him
at
once

in
one
domain
the
principle
of
love
seems
to
have
been
long
outsoared
by
egoism
and
to
be
still
in
need
only
of
sure
consciousness
as
it
were
of
victory
with
a
good
conscience
this
domain
is
speculation
in
its
double
manifestation
as
thinking
and
as
trade
one
thinks
with
a
will
whatever
may
come
of
it
one
speculates
however
many
may
suffer
under
our
speculative
undertakings
but
when
it
finally
becomes
serious
when
even
the
last
remnant
of
religiousness
romance
or
humanity
is
to
be
done
away
then
the
pulse
of
religious
conscience
beats
and
one
at
least
professes
humanity
the
avaricious
speculator
throws
some
coppers
into
the
poor
box
and
does
good
the
bold
thinker
consoles
himself
with
the
fact
that
he
is
working
for
the
advancement
of
the
human
race
and
that
his
devastation
turns
to
the
good
of
mankind
or
in
another
case
that
he
is
serving
the
idea
mankind
the
idea
is
to
him
that
something
of
which
he
must
say
it
is
more
to
me
than
myself
to
this
day
thinking
and
trading
have
been
done
for
q
gods
sake
those
who
for
six
days
were
trampling
down
everything
by
their
selfish
aims
sacrificed
on
the
seventh
to
the
lord
and
those
who
destroyed
a
hundred
good
causes
by
their
reckless
thinking
still
did
this
in
the
service
of
another
good
cause
and
had
yet
to
think
of
another
q
besides
themselves
q
to
whose
good
their
self
indulgence
should
turn
of
the
people
mankind
and
the
like
but
this
other
thing
is
a
being
above
them
a
higher
or
supreme
being
and
therefore
i
say
they
are
toiling
for
gods
sake
hence
i
can
also
say
that
the
ultimate
basis
of
their
actions
is
love
not
a
voluntary
love
however
not
their
own
but
a
tributary
love
or
the
higher
beings
own
gods
who
himself
is
love
in
short
not
the
egoistic
but
the
religious
a
love
that
springs
from
their
fancy
that
they
must
discharge
a
tribute
of
love
that
they
must
not
be
egoists
if
we
want
to
deliver
the
world
from
many
kinds
of
unfreedom
we
want
this
not
on
its
account
but
on
ours
for
as
we
are
not
world
liberators
by
profession
and
out
of
love
we
only
want
to
win
it
away
from
others
we
want
to
make
it
our
own
it
is
not
to
be
any
longer
owned
as
serf
by
god
the
church
nor
by
the
law
state
but
to
be
our
own
therefore
we
seek
to
win
it
to
captivate
it
and
by
meeting
it
halfway
and
devoting
ourselves
to
it
as
to
ourselves
as
soon
as
it
belongs
to
us
to
complete
and
make
superfluous
the
force
that
it
turns
against
us
if
the
world
is
ours
it
no
longer
attempts
any
force
against
us
but
only
with
us
my
selfishness
has
an
interest
in
the
liberation
of
the
world
that
it
may
become
q
my
property
not
isolation
or
being
alone
but
society
is
mans
original
state
our
existence
begins
with
the
most
intimate
conjunction
as
we
are
already
living
with
our
mother
before
we
breathe
when
we
see
the
light
of
the
world
we
at
once
lie
on
a
human
beings
breast
again
her
love
cradles
us
in
the
lap
leads
us
in
the
go
cart
and
chains
us
to
her
person
with
a
thousand
ties
society
is
our
state
of
nature
and
this
is
why
the
more
we
learn
to
feel
ourselves
the
connection
that
was
formerly
most
intimate
becomes
ever
looser
and
the
dissolution
of
the
original
society
more
unmistakable
to
have
once
again
for
herself
the
child
that
once
lay
under
her
heart
the
mother
must
fetch
it
from
the
street
and
from
the
midst
of
its
playmates
the
child
prefers
the
intercourse
that
it
enters
into
with
its
fellows
to
the
society
that
it
has
not
entered
into
but
only
been
born
in
but
the
dissolution
of
society
is
intercourse
or
union
a
society
does
assuredly
arise
by
union
too
but
only
as
a
fixed
idea
arises
by
a
thought
q
to
wit
by
the
vanishing
of
the
energy
of
the
thought
the
thinking
itself
this
restless
taking
back
all
thoughts
that
make
themselves
fast
from
the
thought
if
a
union
has
crystallized
into
a
society
it
has
ceased
to
be
a
coalition

for
coalition
is
an
incessant
self
uniting
it
has
become
a
unitedness
come
to
a
standstill
degenerated
into
a
fixity
it
is
dead
as
a
union
it
is
the
corpse
of
the
union
or
the
coalition
it
is
q
society
community
a
striking
example
of
this
kind
is
furnished
by
the
party
that
a
society
such
as
the
society
of
the
state
diminishes
my
liberty
offends
me
little
why
i
have
to
let
my
liberty
be
limited
by
all
sorts
of
powers
and
by
every
one
who
is
stronger
nay
by
every
fellow
man
and
were
i
the
autocrat
of
all
the
r
i
yet
should
not
enjoy
absolute
liberty
but
ownness
i
will
not
have
taken
from
me
and
ownness
is
precisely
what
every
society
has
designs
on
precisely
what
is
to
succumb
to
its
power
a
society
which
i
join
does
indeed
take
from
me
many
liberties
but
in
return
it
affords
me
other
liberties
neither
does
it
matter
if
i
myself
deprive
myself
of
this
and
that
liberty
such
as
by
any
contract
on
the
other
hand
i
want
to
hold
jealously
to
my
ownness
every
community
has
the
propensity
stronger
or
weaker
according
to
the
fullness
of
its
power
to
become
an
authority
to
its
members
and
to
set
limits
for
them
it
asks
and
must
ask
for
a
subjects
limited
understanding
it
asks
that
those
who
belong
to
it
be
subjected
to
it
be
its
subjects
it
exists
only
by
subjection
in
this
a
certain
tolerance
need
by
no
means
be
excluded
on
the
contrary
the
society
will
welcome
improvements
corrections
and
blame
so
far
as
such
are
calculated
for
its
gain
but
the
blame
must
be
well
meaning
it
may
not
be
insolent
and
disrespectful
q
in
other
words
one
must
leave
uninjured
and
hold
sacred
the
substance
of
the
society
the
society
demands
that
those
who
belong
to
it
shall
not
go
beyond
it
and
exalt
themselves
but
remain
within
the
bounds
of
legality
that
is
allow
themselves
only
so
much
as
the
society
and
its
law
allow
them
there
is
a
difference
whether
my
liberty
or
my
ownness
is
limited
by
a
socie
ty
if
the
former
only
is
the
case
it
is
a
coalition
an
agreement
a
union
but
if
ruin
is
threatened
to
ownness
it
is
a
power
of
itself
a
power
above
me
a
thing
unattainable
by
me
which
i
can
indeed
admire
adore
reverence
respect
but
cannot
subdue
and
consume
and
that
for
the
reason
that
i
am
resigned
it
exists
by
my
resignation
my
self
renunciation
my
spiritlessness

called
q
humility

my
humility
makes
its
courage

my
submissiveness
gives
it
its
dominion
but
in
reference
to
liberty
state
and
union
are
subject
to
no
essential
difference
the
latter
can
just
as
little
come
into
existence
or
continue
in
existence
without
libertys
being
limited
in
all
sorts
of
ways
as
the
state
is
compatible
with
unmeasured
liberty
limitation
of
liberty
is
inevitable
everywhere
for
one
cannot
get
rid
of
everything
one
cannot
fly
like
a
bird
merely
because
one
would
like
to
fly
so
for
one
does
not
get
free
from
his
own
weight
one
cannot
live
under
water
as
long
as
he
likes
like
a
fish
because
one
cannot
do
without
air
and
cannot
get
free
from
this
indispensable
necessity
and
the
like
as
religion
and
most
decidedly
christianity
tormented
man
with
the
demand
to
realize
the
unnatural
and
self
contradictory
so
it
is
to
be
looked
upon
only
as
the
true
logical
outcome
of
that
religious
over
straining
and
overwroughtness
that
finally
liberty
itself
absolute
liberty
was
exalted
into
an
ideal
and
thus
the
nonsense
of
the
impossible
to
come
glaringly
to
the
light
q
the
union
will
assuredly
offer
a
greater
measure
of
liberty
as
well
as
and
especially
because
by
it
one
escapes
all
the
coercion
peculiar
to
state
and
society
life
admit
of
being
considered
as
a
new
liberty
but
nevertheless
it
will
still
contain
enough
of
unfreedom
and
involuntariness
for
its
object
is
not
this
q
liberty
which
on
the
contrary
it
sacrifices
to
ownness
but
only
ownness
referred
to
this
the
difference
between
state
and
union
is
great
enough
the
former
is
an
enemy
and
murderer
of
ownness
the
latter
a
son
and
co
worker
of
it
the
former
a
spirit
that
would
be
adored
in
spirit
and
in
truth
the
latter
my
work
my
product
the
state
is
the
lord
of
my
spirit
who
demands
faith
and
prescribes
to
me
articles
of
faith
the
creed
of
legality
it
exerts
moral
influence
dominates
my
spirit
drives
away
my
ego
to
put
itself
in
its
place
as
my
true
ego
q
in
short
the
state
is
sacred
and
as
against
me
the
individual
man
it
is
the
true
man
the
spirit
the
ghost
but
the
union
is
my
own
creation
my
creature
not
sacred
not
a
spiritual
power
above
my
spirit
as
little
as
any
association
of
whatever
sort
as
i
am
not
willing
to
be
a
slave
of
my
maxims
but
lay
them
bare
to
my
continual
criticism
without
any
warrant
and
admit
no
bail
at
all
for
their
persistence
so
still
less
do
i
obligate
myself
to
the
union
for
my
future
and
pledge
my
soul
to
it
as
is
said
to
be
done
with
the
devil
and
is
really
the
case
with
the
state
and
all
spiritual
authority
but
i
am
and
remain
more
to
myself
than
state
church
god
and
the
like
consequently
infinitely
more
than
the
union
too
that
society
which
communism
wants
to
found
seems
to
stand
nearest
to
coalition
for
it
is
to
aim
at
the
welfare
of
all
oh
yes
of
all
cries
weitling
innumerable
times
of
all
that
does
really
look
as
if
in
it
no
one
needed
to
take
a
back
seat
but
what
then
will
this
welfare
be
have
all
one
and
the
same
welfare
are
all
equally
well
off
with
one
and
the
same
thing
if
that
be
so
the
question
is
of
the
true
welfare
do
we
not
with
this
come
right
to
the
point
where
religion
begins
its
dominion
of
violence
christianity
says
look
not
on
earthly
toys
but
seek
your
true
welfare
become
q
pious
christians
being
christians
is
the
true
welfare
it
is
the
true
welfare
of
all
because
it
is
the
welfare
of
man
as
such
this
spook
now
the
welfare
of
all
is
surely
to
be
your
and
my
welfare
too
but
if
you
and
i
do
not
look
upon
that
welfare
as
our
welfare
will
care
then
be
taken
for
that
in
which
we
feel
well
on
the
contrary
society
has
decreed
a
welfare
as
the
true
welfare
if
this
welfare
were
called
enjoyment
honestly
worked
for
but
if
you
preferred
enjoyable
laziness
enjoyment
without
work
then
society
which
cares
for
the
welfare
of
all
would
wisely
avoid
caring
for
that
in
which
you
are
well
off
communism
in
proclaiming
the
welfare
of
all
annuls
outright
the
well
being
of
those
who
hitherto
lived
on
their
income
from
investments
and
apparently
felt
better
in
that
than
in
the
prospect
of
weitlings
strict
hours
of
labour
hence
the
latter
asserts
that
with
the
welfare
of
thousands
the
welfare
of
millions
cannot
exist
and
the
former
must
give
up
their
special
welfare
for
the
sake
of
the
general
welfare
no
let
people
not
be
summoned
to
sacrifice
their
special
welfare
for
the
general
for
this
christian
admonition
will
not
carry
you
through
they
will
better
understand
the
opposite
admonition
not
to
let
their
own
welfare
be
snatched
from
them
by
anybody
but
to
put
it
on
a
permanent
foundation
then
they
are
of
themselves
led
to
the
point
that
they
care
best
for
their
welfare
if
they
unite
with
others
for
this
purpose
that
is
sacrifice
a
part
of
their
liberty
yet
not
to
the
welfare
of
others
but
to
their
own
an
appeal
to
mens
self
sacrificing
disposition
end
self
renouncing
love
ought
at
least
to
have
lost
its
seductive
plausibility
when
after
an
activity
of
thousands
of
years
it
has
left
nothing
behind
but
the
mis
re
of
today
why
then
still
fruitlessly
expect
self
sacrifice
to
bring
us
better
time
why
not
rather
hope
for
them
from
usurpation
salvation
comes
no
longer
from
the
giver
the
bestower
the
loving
one
but
from
the
taker
the
appropriator
usurper
the
owner
communism
and
consciously
egoism
reviling
humanism
still
count
on
love
if
community
is
once
a
need
of
man
and
he
finds
himself
furthered
by
it
in
his
aims
then
very
soon
because
it
has
become
his
principle
it
prescribes
to
him
its
laws
too
the
laws
of
q
society
the
principle
of
men
exalts
itself
into
a
sovereign
power
over
them
becomes
their
supreme
essence
their
god
and
as
such
q
law
giver
communism
gives
this
principle
the
strictest
effect
and
christianity
is
the
religion
of
society
for
as
feuerbach
rightly
says
although
he
does
not
mean
it
rightly
love
is
the
essence
of
man
that
is
the
essence
of
society
or
of
societary
communistic
man
all
religion
is
a
cult
of
society
this
principle
by
which
societary
cultivated
man
is
dominated
neither
is
any
god
an
egos
exclusive
god
but
always
a
societys
or
communitys
be
it
of
the
society
family
lar
penates
or
of
a
people
national
god
or
of
all
men
he
is
a
father
of
all
men
consequently
one
has
a
prospect
of
extirpating
religion
down
to
the
ground
only
when
one
antiquates
society
and
everything
that
flows
from
this
principle
but
it
is
precisely
in
communism
that
this
principle
seeks
to
culminate
as
in
it
everything
is
to
become
common
for
the
establishment
of
q
equality
if
this
equality
is
won
liberty
too
is
not
lacking
but
whose
liberty
societys
society
is
then
all
in
all
and
men
are
only
for
each
other
it
would
be
the
glory
of
the
q
love
state
but
i
would
rather
be
referred
to
mens
selfishness
than
to
their
kindnesses

their
mercy
pity
etc
the
former
demands
reciprocity
as
thou
to
me
so
i
to
thee
does
nothing
gratis
and
may
be
won
and
q
bought
but
with
what
shall
i
obtain
the
kindness
it
is
a
matter
of
chance
whether
i
am
at
the
time
having
to
do
with
a
loving
person
the
affectionate
ones
service
can
be
had
only
by
q
begging
be
it
by
my
lamentable
appearance
by
my
need
of
help
my
misery
my
q
suffering
what
can
i
offer
him
for
his
assistance
nothing
i
must
accept
it
as
a
q
present
love
is
unpayable
or
rather
love
can
assuredly
be
paid
for
but
only
by
counter
love
one
good
turn
deserves
another
what
paltriness
and
beggarliness
does
it
not
take
to
accept
gifts
year
in
and
year
out
without
service
in
return
as
they
are
regularly
collected
for
instance
from
the
poor
day
labourer
what
can
the
receiver
do
for
him
and
his
donated
pennies
in
which
his
wealth
consists
the
day
labourer
would
really
have
more
enjoyment
if
the
receiver
with
his
laws
his
institutions
etc
all
of
which
the
day
labourer
has
to
pay
for
though
did
not
exist
at
all
and
yet
with
it
all
the
poor
wight
loves
his
master
no
community
as
the
goal
of
history
hitherto
is
impossible
let
us
rather
renounce
every
hypocrisy
of
community
and
recognize
that
if
we
are
equal
as
men
we
are
not
equal
for
the
very
reason
that
we
are
not
men
we
are
equal
only
in
thoughts
only
when
we
are
thought
not
as
we
really
and
bodily
are
i
am
ego
and
you
are
ego
but
i
am
not
this
thought
of
ego
this
ego
in
which
we
are
all
equal
is
only
my
thought
i
am
man
and
you
are
man
but
man
is
only
a
thought
a
generality
neither
i
nor
you
are
speakable
we
are
unutterable
because
only
thoughts
are
speakable
and
consist
in
speaking
let
us
therefore
not
aspire
to
community
but
to
one
sidedness
let
us
not
seek
the
most
comprehensive
commune
human
society
but
let
us
seek
in
others
only
means
and
organs
which
we
may
use
as
our
property
as
we
do
not
see
our
equals
in
the
tree
the
beast
so
the
presupposition
that
others
are
our
equals
springs
from
a
hypocrisy
no
one
is
my
equal
but
i
regard
him
equally
with
all
other
beings
as
my
property
in
opposition
to
this
i
am
told
that
i
should
be
a
man
among
fellow
men
judenfrage
p

i
should
respect
the
fellow
man
in
them
for
me
no
one
is
a
person
to
be
respected
not
even
the
fellow
man
but
solely
like
other
beings
an
object
in
which
i
take
an
interest
or
else
do
not
an
interesting
or
uninteresting
object
a
usable
or
unusable
person
and
if
i
can
use
him
i
doubtless
come
to
an
understanding
and
make
myself
at
one
with
him
in
order
by
the
agreement
to
strengthen
my
power
and
by
combined
force
to
accomplish
more
than
individual
force
could
effect
in
this
combination
i
see
nothing
whatever
but
a
multiplication
of
my
force
and
i
retain
it
only
so
long
as
it
is
my
multiplied
force
but
thus
it
is
a
q
union
neither
a
natural
ligature
nor
a
spiritual
one
holds
the
union
together
and
it
is
not
a
natural
not
a
spiritual
league
it
is
not
brought
about
by
one
blood
not
by
one
faith
spirit
in
a
natural
league
q
like
a
family
a
tribe
a
nation
yes
mankind
q
the
individuals
have
only
the
value
of
specimens
of
the
same
species
or
genus
in
a
spiritual
league
q
like
a
commune
a
church
q
the
individual
signifies
only
a
member
of
the
same
spirit
what
you
are
in
both
cases
as
a
unique
person
must
be
q
suppressed
only
in
the
union
can
you
assert
yourself
as
unique
because
the
union
does
not
possess
you
but
you
possess
it
or
make
it
of
use
to
you
property
is
recognized
in
the
union
and
only
in
the
union
because
one
no
longer
holds
what
is
his
as
a
fief
from
any
being
the
communists
are
only
consistently
carrying
further
what
had
already
been
long
present
during
religious
evolution
and
especially
in
the
state
to
wit
propertylessness
the
feudal
system
the
state
exerts
itself
to
tame
the
desirous
man
in
other
words
it
seeks
to
direct
his
desire
to
it
alone
and
to
content
that
desire
with
what
it
offers
to
sate
the
desire
for
the
desirous
mans
sake
does
not
come
into
the
mind
on
the
contrary
it
stigmatizes
as
an
egoistic
man
the
man
who
breathes
out
unbridled
desire
and
the
egoistic
man
is
its
enemy
he
is
this
for
it
because
the
capacity
to
agree
with
him
is
wanting
to
the
state
the
egoist
is
precisely
what
it
cannot
comprehend
since
the
state
as
nothing
else
is
possible
has
to
do
only
for
itself
it
does
not
take
care
for
my
needs
but
takes
care
only
of
how
it
make
away
with
me
make
out
of
me
another
ego
a
good
citizen
it
takes
measures
for
the
improvement
of
morals
q
and
with
what
does
it
win
individuals
for
itself
with
itself
with
what
is
the
states
with
state
property
it
will
be
unremittingly
active
in
making
all
participants
in
its
goods
providing
all
with
the
good
things
of
culture
it
presents
them
its
education
opens
to
them
the
access
to
its
institutions
of
culture
capacitates
them
to
come
to
property
as
to
a
fief
in
the
way
of
industry
etc
for
all
these
fiefs
it
demands
only
the
just
rent
of
continual
thanks
but
the
unthankful
forget
to
pay
these
thanks
q
now
neither
can
society
do
essentially
otherwise
than
the
state
you
bring
into
a
union
your
whole
power
your
competence
and
make
yourself
count
in
a
society
you
are
employed
with
your
working
power
in
the
former
you
live
egoistically
in
the
latter
humanly
that
is
religiously
as
a
member
in
the
body
of
this
lord
to
a
society
you
owe
what
you
have
and
are
in
duty
bound
to
it
are
q
possessed
by
social
duties
a
union
you
utilize
and
give
it
up
undutifully
and
unfaithfully
when
you
see
no
way
to
use
it
further
if
a
society
is
more
than
you
then
it
is
more
to
you
than
yourself
a
union
is
only
your
instrument
or
the
sword
with
which
you
sharpen
and
increase
your
natural
force
the
union
exists
for
you
and
through
you
the
society
conversely
lays
claim
to
you
for
itself
and
exists
even
without
you
in
short
the
society
is
sacred
the
union
your
own
consumes
you
you
consume
the
union
nevertheless
people
will
not
be
backward
with
the
objection
that
the
agreement
which
has
been
concluded
may
again
become
burdensome
to
us
and
limit
our
freedom
they
will
say
we
too
would
at
last
come
to
this
that
every
one
must
sacrifice
a
part
of
his
freedom
for
the
sake
of
the
generality
but
the
sacrifice
would
not
be
made
for
the
generalitys
sake
a
bit
as
little
as
i
concluded
the
agreement
for
the
generalitys
or
even
for
any
other
mans
sake
rather
i
came
into
it
only
for
the
sake
of
my
own
benefit
from
selfishness

but
as
regards
the
sacrificing
surely
i
sacrifice
only
that
which
does
not
stand
in
my
power
that
is
i
sacrifice
nothing
at
all
to
come
back
to
property
the
lord
is
proprietor
choose
then
whether
you
want
to
be
lord
or
whether
society
shall
be
on
this
depends
whether
you
are
to
be
an
owner
or
a
ragamuffin
the
egoist
is
owner
the
socialist
a
ragamuffin
but
ragamuffinism
or
propertylessness
is
the
sense
of
feudalism
of
the
feudal
system
which
since
the
last
century
has
only
changed
its
overlord
putting
man
in
the
place
of
god
and
accepting
as
a
fief
from
man
what
had
before
been
a
fief
from
the
grace
of
god
that
the
ragamuffinism
of
communism
is
carried
out
by
the
humane
principle
into
the
absolute
or
most
ragamuffinly
ragamuffinism
has
been
shown
above
but
at
the
same
time
also
how
ragamuffinism
can
only
thus
swing
around
into
ownness
the
old
feudal
system
was
so
thoroughly
trampled
into
the
ground
in
the
revolution
that
since
then
all
reactionary
craft
has
remained
fruitless
and
will
always
remain
fruitless
because
the
dead
is
q
dead
but
the
resurrection
too
had
to
prove
itself
a
truth
in
christian
history
and
has
so
proved
itself
for
in
another
world
feudalism
is
risen
again
with
a
glorified
body
the
new
feudalism
under
the
suzerainty
of
man
christianity
is
not
annihilated
but
the
faithful
are
right
in
having
hitherto
trustfully
assumed
of
every
combat
against
it
that
this
could
serve
only
for
the
purgation
and
confirmation
of
christianity
for
it
has
really
only
been
glorified
and
christianity
exposed
is
the
q
human
christianity
we
are
still
living
entirely
in
the
christian
age
and
the
very
ones
who
feel
worst
about
it
are
the
most
zealously
contributing
to
complete
it
the
more
human
the
dearer
has
feudalism
become
to
us
for
we
the
less
believe
that
it
still
is
feudalism
we
take
it
the
more
confidently
for
ownness
and
think
we
have
found
what
is
most
absolutely
our
own
when
we
discover
the
human
liberalism
wants
to
give
me
what
is
mine
but
it
thinks
to
procure
it
for
me
not
under
the
title
of
mine
but
under
that
of
the
human
as
if
it
were
attainable
under
this
mask
the
rights
of
man
the
precious
work
of
the
revolution
have
the
meaning
that
the
man
in
me
entitles

me
to
this
and
that
i
as
individual
as
this
man
am
not
entitled
but
man
has
the
right
and
entitles
me
hence
as
man
i
may
well
be
entitled
but
as
i
am
more
than
man
to
wit
a
special
man
it
may
be
refused
to
this
very
me
the
special
one
if
on
the
other
hand
you
insist
on
the
value
of
your
gifts
keep
up
their
price
do
not
let
yourselves
be
forced
to
sell
out
below
price
do
not
let
yourselves
be
talked
into
the
idea
that
your
ware
is
not
worth
its
price
do
not
make
yourself
ridiculous
by
a
ridiculous
price
but
imitate
the
brave
man
who
says
i
will
sell
my
life
property
dear
the
enemy
shall
not
have
it
at
a
cheap
bargain
then
you
have
recognized
the
reverse
of
communism
as
the
correct
thing
and
the
word
then
is
not
give
up
your
property
but
get
the
value
out
of
your
property
over
the
portal
of
our
time
stands
not
that
know
thyself
of
apollo
but
a
get
the
value
out
of
thyself
proudhon
calls
property
robbery
le
vol
but
alien
property
q
and
he
is
talking
of
this
alone
q
is
not
less
existent
by
renunciation
cession
and
humility
it
is
a
present
why
so
sentimentally
call
for
compassion
as
a
poor
victim
of
robbery
when
one
is
just
a
foolish
cowardly
giver
of
presents
why
here
again
put
the
fault
on
others
as
if
they
were
robbing
us
while
we
ourselves
do
bear
the
fault
in
leaving
the
others
unrobbed
the
poor
are
to
blame
for
there
being
rich
men
universally
no
one
grows
indignant
at
his
but
at
alien
property
they
do
not
in
truth
attack
property
but
the
alienation
of
property
they
want
to
be
able
to
call
more
not
less
theirs
they
want
to
call
everything
theirs
they
are
fighting
therefore
against
alienness
or
to
form
a
word
similar
to
property
against
alienty
and
how
do
they
help
themselves
therein
instead
of
transforming
the
alien
into
own
they
play
impartial
and
ask
only
that
all
property
be
left
to
a
third
party
such
as
human
society
they
revindicate
the
alien
not
in
their
own
name
but
in
a
third
partys
now
the
egoistic
colouring
is
wiped
off
and
everything
is
so
clean
and
q
human
propertylessness
or
ragamuffinism
this
then
is
the
essence
of
christianity
as
it
is
essence
of
all
religiousness
godliness
morality
humanity
and
only
announced
itself
most
clearly
and
as
glad
tidings
became
a
gospel
capable
of
development
in
the
absolute
religion
we
have
before
us
the
most
striking
development
in
the
present
fight
against
property
a
fight
which
is
to
bring
man
to
victory
and
make
propertylessness
complete
victorious
humanity
is
the
victory
of
q
christianity
but
the
christianity
exposed
thus
is
feudalism
completed
the
most
all
embracing
feudal
system
that
is
perfect
ragamuffinism
once
more
then
doubtless
a
revolution
against
the
feudal
system
q
revolution
and
insurrection
must
not
be
looked
upon
as
synonymous
the
former
consists
in
an
overturning
of
conditions
of
the
established
condition
or
status
the
state
or
society
and
is
accordingly
a
political
or
social
act
the
latter
has
indeed
for
its
unavoidable
consequence
a
transformation
of
circumstances
yet
does
not
start
from
it
but
from
mens
discontent
with
themselves
is
not
an
armed
rising
but
a
rising
of
individuals
a
getting
up
without
regard
to
the
arrangements
that
spring
from
it
the
revolution
aimed
at
new
arrangements
insurrection
leads
us
no
longer
to
let
ourselves
be
arranged
but
to
arrange
ourselves
and
sets
no
glittering
hopes
on
institutions
it
is
not
a
fight
against
the
established
since
if
it
prospers
the
established
collapses
of
itself
it
is
only
a
working
forth
of
me
out
of
the
established
if
i
leave
the
established
it
is
dead
and
passes
into
decay
now
as
my
object
is
not
the
overthrow
of
an
established
order
but
my
elevation
above
it
my
purpose
and
deed
are
not
a
political
or
social
but
as
directed
toward
myself
and
my
ownness
alone
an
egoistic
purpose
and
deed
the
revolution
commands
one
to
make
arrangements
the
insurrection
demands
that
he
rise
or
exalt
himself

what
constitution
was
to
be
chosen
this
question
busied
the
revolutionary
heads
and
the
whole
political
period
foams
with
constitutional
fights
and
constitutional
questions
as
the
social
talents
too
were
uncommonly
inventive
in
societary
arrangements
phalansteries
and
the
like
the
insurgent
strives
to
become
constitutionless
while
to
get
greater
clearness
i
am
thinking
up
a
comparison
the
founding
of
christianity
comes
unexpectedly
into
my
mind
on
the
liberal
side
it
is
noted
as
a
bad
point
in
the
first
christians
that
they
preached
obedience
to
the
established
heathen
civil
order
enjoined
recognition
of
the
heathen
authorities
and
confidently
delivered
a
command
give
to
the
emperor
that
which
is
the
emperors
yet
how
much
disturbance
arose
at
the
same
time
against
the
roman
supremacy
how
mutinous
did
the
jews
and
even
the
romans
show
themselves
against
their
own
temporal
government
in
short
how
popular
was
political
discontent
those
christians
would
hear
nothing
of
it
would
not
side
with
the
liberal
tendencies
the
time
was
politically
so
agitated
that
as
is
said
in
the
gospels
people
thought
they
could
not
accuse
the
founder
of
christianity
more
successfully
than
if
they
arraigned
him
for
political
intrigue
and
yet
the
same
gospels
report
that
he
was
precisely
the
one
who
took
least
part
in
these
political
doings
but
why
was
he
not
a
revolutionist
not
a
demagogue
as
the
jews
would
gladly
have
seen
him
why
was
he
not
a
liberal
because
he
expected
no
salvation
from
a
change
of
conditions
and
this
whole
business
was
indifferent
to
him
he
was
not
a
revolutionist
like
caesar
but
an
insurgent
not
a
state
overturner
but
one
who
straightened
himself
up
that
was
why
it
was
for
him
only
a
matter
of
be
ye
wise
as
serpents
which
expresses
the
same
sense
as
in
the
special
case
that
give
to
the
emperor
that
which
is
the
emperors
for
he
was
not
carrying
on
any
liberal
or
political
fight
against
the
established
authorities
but
wanted
to
walk
his
own
way
untroubled
about
and
undisturbed
by
these
authorities
not
less
indifferent
to
him
than
the
government
were
its
enemies
for
neither
understood
what
he
wanted
and
he
had
only
to
keep
them
off
from
him
with
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
but
even
though
not
a
ringleader
of
popular
mutiny
not
a
demagogue
or
revolutionist
he
and
every
one
of
the
ancient
christians
was
so
much
the
more
an
insurgent
who
lifted
himself
above
everything
that
seemed
sublime
to
the
government
and
its
opponents
and
absolved
himself
from
everything
that
they
remained
bound
to
and
who
at
the
same
time
cut
off
the
sources
of
life
of
the
whole
heathen
world
with
which
the
established
state
must
wither
away
as
a
matter
of
course
precisely
because
he
put
from
him
the
upsetting
of
the
established
he
was
its
deadly
enemy
and
real
annihilator
for
he
walled
it
in
confidently
and
recklessly
carrying
up
the
building
of
his
temple
over
it
without
heeding
the
pains
of
the
immured
now
as
it
happened
to
the
heathen
order
of
the
world
will
the
christian
order
fare
likewise
a
revolution
certainly
does
not
bring
on
the
end
if
an
insurrection
is
not
consummated
first
my
intercourse
with
the
world
what
does
it
aim
at
i
want
to
have
the
enjoyment
of
it
therefore
it
must
be
my
property
and
therefore
i
want
to
win
it
i
do
not
want
the
liberty
of
men
nor
their
equality
i
want
only
my
power
over
them
i
want
to
make
them
my
property
material
for
enjoyment
and
if
i
do
not
succeed
in
that
well
then
i
call
even
the
power
over
life
and
death
which
church
and
state
reserved
to
themselves
q
mine
brand
that
officers
widow
who
in
the
flight
in
russia
after
her
leg
has
been
shot
away
takes
the
garter
from
it
strangles
her
child
therewith
and
then
bleeds
to
death
alongside
the
corpse
q
brand
the
memory
of
the
q
infanticide
who
knows
if
this
child
had
remained
alive
how
much
it
might
have
been
of
use
to
the
world
the
mother
murdered
it
because
she
wanted
to
die
satisfied
and
at
rest
perhaps
this
case
still
appeals
to
your
sentimentality
and
you
do
not
know
how
to
read
out
of
it
anything
further
be
it
so
i
on
my
part
use
it
as
an
example
for
this
that
my
satisfaction
decides
about
my
relation
to
men
and
that
i
do
not
renounce
from
any
access
of
humility
even
the
power
over
life
and
death
as
regards
social
duties
in
general
another
does
not
give
me
my
position
toward
others
therefore
neither
god
nor
humanity
prescribes
to
me
my
relation
to
men
but
i
give
myself
this
position
this
is
more
strikingly
said
thus
i
have
no
duty
to
others
as
i
have
a
duty
even
to
myself
that
of
self
preservation
and
therefore
not
suicide
only
so
long
as
i
distinguish
myself
from
myself
my
immortal
soul
from
my
earthly
existence
etc
i
no
longer
humble
myself
before
any
power
and
i
recognize
that
all
powers
are
only
my
power
which
i
have
to
subject
at
once
when
they
threaten
to
become
a
power
against
or
above
me
each
of
them
must
be
only
one
of
my
means
to
carry
my
point
as
a
hound
is
our
power
against
game
but
is
killed
by
us
if
it
should
fall
upon
us
ourselves
all
powers
that
dominate
me
i
then
reduce
to
serving
me
the
idols
exist
through
me
i
need
only
refrain
from
creating
them
anew
then
they
exist
no
longer
higher
powers
exist
only
through
my
exalting
them
and
abasing
myself
consequently
my
relation
to
the
world
is
this
i
no
longer
do
anything
for
it
for
gods
sake
i
do
nothing
for
mans
sake
but
what
i
do
i
do
for
my
sake
thus
alone
does
the
world
satisfy
me
while
it
is
characteristic
of
the
religious
stand
point
in
which
i
include
the
moral
and
humane
also
that
from
it
everything
remains
a
pious
wish
pium
desiderium
an
other
world
matter
something
unattained
thus
the
general
salvation
of
men
the
moral
world
of
a
general
love
eternal
peace
the
cessation
of
egoism
etc
nothing
in
this
world
is
perfect
with
this
miserable
phrase
the
good
part
from
it
and
take
flight
into
their
closet
to
god
or
into
their
proud
self
consciousness
but
we
remain
in
this
imperfect
world
because
even
so
we
can
use
it
for
our
self
enjoyment
my
intercourse
with
the
world
consists
in
my
enjoying
it
and
so
consuming
it
for
my
self
enjoyment
intercourse
is
the
enjoyment
of
the
world
and
belongs
to
my
q
self
enjoyment
c
my
self
enjoyment
we
stand
at
the
boundary
of
a
period
the
world
hitherto
took
thought
for
nothing
but
the
gain
of
life
took
care
for
q
life
for
whether
all
activity
is
put
on
the
stretch
for
the
life
of
this
world
or
of
the
other
for
the
temporal
or
for
the
eternal
whether
one
hankers
for
daily
bread
give
us
our
daily
bread
or
for
holy
bread
the
true
bread
from
heaven
the
bread
of
god
that
comes
from
heaven
and
gives
life
to
the
world
the
bread
of
life
john

whether
one
takes
care
for
dear
life
or
for
life
to
eternity
q
this
does
not
change
the
object
of
the
strain
and
care
which
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
shows
itself
to
be
life
do
the
modern
tendencies
announce
themselves
otherwise
people
now
want
nobody
to
be
embarrassed
for
the
most
indispensable
necessaries
of
life
but
want
every
one
to
feel
secure
as
to
these
and
on
the
other
hand
they
teach
that
man
has
this
life
to
attend
to
and
the
real
world
to
adapt
himself
to
without
vain
care
for
another
let
us
take
up
the
same
thing
from
another
side
when
one
is
anxious
only
to
live
he
easily
in
this
solicitude
forgets
the
enjoyment
of
life
if
his
only
concern
is
for
life
and
he
thinks
if
i
only
have
my
dear
life
he
does
not
apply
his
full
strength
to
using
that
is
enjoying
life
but
how
does
one
use
life
in
using
it
up
like
the
candle
which
one
uses
in
burning
it
up
one
uses
life
and
consequently
himself
the
living
one
in
consuming
it
and
himself
enjoyment
of
life
is
using
life
up
now
q
we
are
in
search
of
the
enjoyment
of
life
and
what
did
the
religious
world
do
it
went
in
search
of
life
wherein
consists
the
true
life
the
blessed
life
etc
how
is
it
to
be
attained
what
must
man
do
and
become
in
order
to
become
a
truly
living
man
how
does
he
fulfil
this
calling
these
and
similar
questions
indicate
that
the
askers
were
still
seeking
for
themselves
q
to
wit
themselves
in
the
true
sense
in
the
sense
of
true
living
what
i
am
is
foam
and
shadow
what
i
shall
be
is
my
true
self
to
chase
after
this
self
to
produce
it
to
realize
it
constitutes
the
hard
task
of
mortals
who
die
only
to
rise
again
live
only
to
die
live
only
to
find
the
true
life
not
till
i
am
certain
of
myself
and
no
longer
seeking
for
myself
am
i
really
my
property
i
have
myself
therefore
i
use
and
enjoy
myself
on
the
other
hand
i
can
never
take
comfort
in
myself
as
long
as
i
think
that
i
have
still
to
find
my
true
self
and
that
it
must
come
to
this
that
not
i
but
christ
or
some
other
spiritual
ghostly
self
the
true
man
the
essence
of
man
and
the
like
lives
in
me
a
vast
interval
separates
the
two
views
in
the
old
i
go
toward
myself
in
the
new
i
start
from
myself
in
the
former
i
long
for
myself
in
the
latter
i
have
myself
and
do
with
myself
as
one
does
with
any
other
property
q
i
enjoy
myself
at
my
pleasure
i
am
no
longer
afraid
for
my
life
but
squander
it
henceforth
the
question
runs
not
how
one
can
acquire
life
but
how
one
can
squander
enjoy
it
or
not
how
one
is
to
produce
the
true
self
in
himself
but
how
one
is
to
dissolve
himself
to
live
himself
out
what
else
should
the
ideal
be
but
the
sought
for
ever
distant
self
one
seeks
for
himself
consequently
one
doth
not
yet
have
himself
one
aspires
toward
what
one
ought
to
be
consequently
one
is
not
it
one
lives
in
longing
and
has
lived
thousands
of
years
in
it
in
hope
living
is
quite
another
thing
in
enjoyment
does
this
perchance
apply
only
to
the
so
called
pious
no
it
applies
to
all
who
belong
to
the
departing
period
of
history
even
to
its
men
of
pleasure
for
them
too
the
work
days
were
followed
by
a
sunday
and
the
rush
of
the
world
by
the
dream
of
a
better
world
of
a
general
happiness
of
humanity
in
short
by
an
ideal
but
philosophers
especially
are
contrasted
with
the
pious
now
have
they
been
thinking
of
anything
else
than
the
ideal
been
planning
for
anything
else
than
the
absolute
self
longing
and
hope
everywhere
and
nothing
but
these
for
me
call
it
romanticism
if
the
enjoyment
of
life
is
to
triumph
over
the
longing
for
life
or
hope
of
life
it
must
vanquish
this
in
its
double
significance
which
schiller
introduces
in
his
ideal
and
life
it
must
crush
spiritual
and
secular
poverty
exterminate
the
ideal
and
q
the
want
of
daily
bread
he
who
must
expend
his
life
to
prolong
life
cannot
enjoy
it
and
he
who
is
still
seeking
for
his
life
does
not
have
it
and
can
as
as
little
enjoy
it
both
are
poor
but
blessed
are
the
poor
those
who
are
hungering
for
the
true
life
have
no
power
over
their
present
life
but
must
apply
it
for
the
purpose
of
thereby
gaining
that
true
life
and
must
sacrifice
it
entirely
to
this
aspiration
and
this
task
if
in
the
case
of
those
devotees
who
hope
for
a
life
in
the
other
world
and
look
upon
that
in
this
world
as
merely
a
preparation
for
it
the
tributariness
of
their
earthly
existence
which
they
put
solely
into
the
service
of
the
hoped
for
heavenly
existence
is
pretty
distinctly
apparent
one
would
yet
go
far
wrong
if
one
wanted
to
consider
the
most
rationalistic
and
enlightened
as
less
self
sacrificing
oh
there
is
to
be
found
in
the
true
life
a
much
more
comprehensive
significance
than
the
heavenly
is
competent
to
express
now
is
not
q
to
introduce
the
liberal
concept
of
it
at
once
q
the
human
and
truly
human
life
the
true
one
and
is
every
one
already
leading
this
truly
human
life
from
the
start
or
must
he
first
raise
himself
to
it
with
hard
toil
does
he
already
have
it
as
his
present
life
or
must
he
struggle
for
it
as
his
future
life
which
will
become
his
part
only
when
he
is
no
longer
tainted
with
any
egoism
in
this
view
life
exists
only
to
gain
life
and
one
lives
only
to
make
the
essence
of
man
alive
in
oneself
one
lives
for
the
sake
of
this
essence
one
has
his
life
only
in
order
to
procure
by
means
of
it
the
true
life
cleansed
of
all
egoism
hence
one
is
afraid
to
make
any
use
he
likes
of
his
life
it
is
to
serve
only
for
the
right
use
in
short
one
has
a
calling
in
life
a
task
in
life
one
has
something
to
realize
and
produce
by
his
life
a
something
for
which
our
life
is
only
means
and
implement
a
something
that
is
worth
more
than
this
life
a
something
to
which
one
owes
his
life
one
has
a
god
who
asks
a
living
sacrifice
only
the
rudeness
of
human
sacrifice
has
been
lost
with
time
human
sacrifice
itself
has
remained
unabated
and
criminals
hourly
fall
sacrifices
to
justice
and
we
poor
sinners
slay
our
own
selves
as
sacrifices
for
the
human
essence
the
idea
of
mankind
humanity
and
whatever
the
idols
or
gods
are
called
besides
but
because
we
owe
our
life
to
that
something
therefore
q
this
is
the
next
point
q
we
have
no
right
to
take
it
from
us
the
conservative
tendency
of
christianity
does
not
permit
thinking
of
death
otherwise
than
with
the
purpose
to
take
its
sting
from
it
and
q
live
on
and
preserve
oneself
nicely
the
christian
lets
everything
happen
and
come
upon
him
if
he
the
arch
jew
q
can
only
haggle
and
smuggle
himself
into
heaven
he
must
not
kill
himself
he
must
only
q
preserve
himself
and
work
at
the
preparation
of
a
future
abode
conservatism
or
conquest
of
death
lies
at
his
heart
the
last
enemy
that
is
abolished
is
death

christ
has
taken
the
power
from
death
and
brought
life
and
imperishable
being
to
light
by
the
gospel

imperishableness
stability
the
moral
man
wants
the
good
the
right
and
if
he
takes
to
the
means
that
lead
to
this
goal
really
lead
to
it
then
these
means
are
not
his
means
but
those
of
the
good
right
etc
itself
these
means
are
never
immoral
because
the
good
end
itself
mediates
itself
through
them
the
end
sanctifies
the
means
they
call
this
maxim
jesuitical
but
it
is
moral
through
and
through
the
moral
man
acts
in
the
service
of
an
end
or
an
idea
he
makes
himself
the
tool
of
the
idea
of
the
good
as
the
pious
man
counts
it
his
glory
to
be
a
tool
or
instrument
of
god
to
await
death
is
what
the
moral
commandment
postulates
as
the
good
to
give
it
to
oneself
is
immoral
and
bad
suicide
finds
no
excuse
before
the
judgment
seat
of
morality
if
the
religious
man
forbids
it
because
you
have
not
given
yourself
life
but
god
who
alone
can
also
take
it
from
you
again
as
if
even
taking
in
this
conception
god
did
not
take
it
from
me
just
as
much
when
i
kill
myself
as
when
a
tile
from
the
roof
or
a
hostile
bullet
fells
me
for
he
would
have
aroused
the
resolution
of
death
in
me
too
the
moral
man
forbids
it
because
i
owe
my
life
to
the
fatherland
etc
because
i
do
not
know
whether
i
may
not
yet
accomplish
good
by
my
life
of
course
for
in
me
good
loses
a
tool
as
god
does
an
instrument
if
i
am
immoral
the
good
is
served
in
my
amendment
if
i
am
ungodly
god
has
joy
in
my
penitence
suicide
therefore
is
ungodly
as
well
as
nefarious
if
one
whose
stand
point
is
religiousness
takes
his
own
life
he
acts
in
forgetfulness
of
god
but
if
the
suicides
stand
point
is
morality
he
acts
in
forgetfulness
of
duty
immorally
people
worried
themselves
much
with
the
question
whether
emilia
galottis
death
can
be
justified
before
morality
they
take
it
as
if
it
were
suicide
which
it
is
too
in
substance
that
she
is
so
infatuated
with
chastity
this
moral
good
as
to
yield
up
even
her
life
for
it
is
certainly
moral
but
again
that
she
fears
the
weakness
of
her
flesh
is
immoral

such
contradictions
form
the
tragic
conflict
universally
in
the
moral
drama
and
one
must
think
and
feel
morally
to
be
able
to
take
an
interest
in
it
what
holds
good
of
piety
and
morality
will
necessarily
apply
to
humanity
also
because
one
owes
his
life
likewise
to
man
mankind
or
the
species
only
when
i
am
under
obligation
to
no
being
is
the
maintaining
of
life
q
my
affair
a
leap
from
this
bridge
makes
me
free
but
if
we
owe
the
maintaining
of
our
life
to
that
being
that
we
are
to
make
alive
in
ourselves
it
is
not
less
our
duty
not
to
lead
this
life
according
to
our
pleasure
but
to
shape
it
in
conformity
to
that
being
all
my
feeling
thinking
and
willing
all
my
doing
and
designing
belongs
to
q
him
what
is
in
conformity
to
that
being
is
to
be
inferred
from
his
concept
and
how
differently
has
this
concept
been
conceived
or
how
differently
has
that
being
been
imagined
what
demands
the
supreme
being
makes
on
the
mohammedan
what
different
ones
the
christian
again
thinks
he
hears
from
him
how
divergent
therefore
must
the
shaping
of
the
lives
of
the
two
turn
out
only
this
do
all
hold
fast
that
the
supreme
being
is
to
judge
our
life
but
the
pious
who
have
their
judge
in
god
and
in
his
word
a
book
of
directions
for
their
life
i
everywhere
pass
by
only
reminiscently
because
they
belong
to
a
period
of
development
that
has
been
lived
through
and
as
petrifactions
they
may
remain
in
their
fixed
place
right
along
in
our
time
it
is
no
longer
the
pious
but
the
liberals
who
have
the
floor
and
piety
itself
cannot
keep
from
reddening
its
pale
face
with
liberal
colouring
but
the
liberals
do
not
adore
their
judge
in
god
and
do
not
unfold
their
life
by
the
directions
of
the
divine
word
but
regulate
themselves
by
man
they
want
to
be
not
divine
but
human
and
to
live
so
man
is
the
liberals
supreme
being
man
the
judge
of
his
life
humanity
his
directions
or
catechism
god
is
spirit
but
man
is
the
most
perfect
spirit
the
final
result
of
the
long
chase
after
the
spirit
or
of
the
searching
in
the
depths
of
the
godhead
that
is
in
the
depths
of
the
spirit
every
one
of
your
traits
is
to
be
human
you
yourself
are
to
be
so
from
top
to
toe
in
the
inward
as
in
the
outward
for
humanity
is
your
calling
calling
q
destiny
q
task
q
what
one
can
become
he
does
become
a
born
poet
may
well
be
hindered
by
the
disfavour
of
circumstances
from
standing
on
the
high
level
of
his
time
and
after
the
great
studies
that
are
indispensable
for
this
producing
consummate
works
of
art
but
he
will
make
poetry
be
he
a
plowman
or
so
lucky
as
to
live
at
the
court
of
weimar
a
born
musician
will
make
music
no
matter
whether
on
all
instruments
or
only
on
an
oaten
pipe
a
born
philosophical
head
can
give
proof
of
itself
as
university
philosopher
or
as
village
philosopher
finally
a
born
dolt
who
as
is
very
well
compatible
with
this
may
at
the
same
time
be
a
sly
boots
will
as
probably
every
one
who
has
visited
schools
is
in
a
position
to
exemplify
to
himself
by
many
instances
of
fellow
scholars
always
remain
a
blockhead
let
him
have
been
drilled
and
trained
into
the
chief
of
a
bureau
or
let
him
serve
that
same
chief
as
bootblack
nay
the
born
shallow
pates
indisputably
form
the
most
numerous
class
of
men
and
why
indeed
should
not
the
same
distinctions
show
themselves
in
the
human
species
that
are
unmistakable
in
every
species
of
beasts
the
more
gifted
and
the
less
gifted
are
to
be
found
everywhere
only
a
few
however
are
so
imbecile
that
one
could
not
get
ideas
into
them
hence
people
usually
consider
all
men
capable
of
having
religion
in
a
certain
degree
they
may
be
trained
to
other
ideas
too
to
some
musical
intelligence
even
some
philosophy
at
this
point
then
the
priesthood
of
religion
of
morality
of
culture
of
science
etc
takes
its
start
and
the
communists
for
instance
want
to
make
everything
accessible
to
all
by
their
public
school
there
is
heard
a
common
assertion
that
this
great
mass
cannot
get
along
without
religion
the
communists
broaden
it
into
the
proposition
that
not
only
the
great
mass
but
absolutely
all
are
called
to
everything
not
enough
that
the
great
mass
has
been
trained
to
religion
now
it
is
actually
to
have
to
occupy
itself
with
everything
human
training
is
growing
ever
more
general
and
more
comprehensive
you
poor
beings
who
could
live
so
happily
if
you
might
skip
according
to
your
mind
you
are
to
dance
to
the
pipe
of
schoolmasters
and
bear
leaders
in
order
to
perform
tricks
that
you
yourselves
would
never
use
yourselves
for
and
you
do
not
even
kick
out
of
the
traces
at
last
against
being
always
taken
otherwise
than
you
want
to
give
yourselves
no
you
mechanically
recite
to
yourselves
the
question
that
is
recited
to
you
what
am
i
called
to
what
ought
i
to
do
you
need
only
ask
thus
to
have
yourselves
told
what
you
ought
to
do
and
ordered
to
do
it
to
have
your
calling
marked
out
for
you
or
else
to
order
yourselves
and
impose
it
on
yourselves
according
to
the
spirits
prescription
then
in
reference
to
the
will
the
word
is
i
will
to
do
what
i
ought
a
man
is
called
to
nothing
and
has
no
calling
no
destiny
as
little
as
a
plant
or
a
beast
has
a
calling
the
flower
does
not
follow
the
calling
to
complete
itself
but
it
spends
all
its
forces
to
enjoy
and
consume
the
world
as
well
as
it
can
q
it
sucks
in
as
much
of
the
juices
of
the
earth
as
much
air
of
the
ether
as
much
light
of
the
sun
as
it
can
get
and
lodge
the
bird
lives
up
to
no
calling
but
it
uses
its
forces
as
much
as
is
practicable
it
catches
beetles
and
sings
to
its
hearts
delight
but
the
forces
of
the
flower
and
the
bird
are
slight
in
comparison
to
those
of
a
man
and
a
man
who
applies
his
forces
will
affect
the
world
much
more
powerfully
than
flower
and
beast
a
calling
he
has
not
but
he
has
forces
that
manifest
themselves
where
they
are
because
their
being
consists
solely
in
their
manifestation
and
are
as
little
able
to
abide
inactive
as
life
which
if
it
stood
still
only
a
second
would
no
longer
be
life
now
one
might
call
out
to
the
man
use
your
force
yet
to
this
imperative
would
be
given
the
meaning
that
it
was
mans
task
to
use
his
force
it
is
not
so
rather
each
one
really
uses
his
force
without
first
looking
upon
this
as
his
calling
at
all
times
every
one
uses
as
much
force
as
he
possesses
one
does
say
of
a
beaten
man
that
he
ought
to
have
exerted
his
force
more
but
one
forgets
that
if
in
the
moment
of
succumbing
he
had
had
the
force
to
exert
his
forces
bodily
forces
he
would
not
have
failed
to
do
it
even
if
it
was
only
the
discouragement
of
a
minute
this
was
yet
a
q
destitution
of
force
a
minute
long
forces
may
assuredly
be
sharpened
and
redoubled
especially
by
hostile
resistance
or
friendly
assistance
but
where
one
misses
their
application
one
may
be
sure
of
their
absence
too
one
can
strike
fire
out
of
a
stone
but
without
the
blow
none
comes
out
in
like
manner
a
man
too
needs
impact
now
for
this
reason
that
forces
always
of
themselves
show
themselves
operative
the
command
to
use
them
would
be
superfluous
and
senseless
to
use
his
forces
is
not
mans
calling
and
task
but
is
his
act
real
and
extant
at
all
times
force
is
only
a
simpler
word
for
manifestation
of
force
now
as
this
rose
is
a
true
rose
to
begin
with
this
nightingale
always
a
true
nightingale
so
i
am
not
for
the
first
time
a
true
man
when
i
fulfil
my
calling
live
up
to
my
destiny
but
i
am
a
true
man
from
the
start
my
first
babble
is
the
token
of
the
life
of
a
true
man
the
struggles
of
my
life
are
the
outpourings
of
his
force
my
last
breath
is
the
last
exhalation
of
the
force
of
the
man
the
true
man
does
not
lie
in
the
future
an
object
of
longing
but
lies
existent
and
real
in
the
present
whatever
and
whoever
i
may
be
joyous
and
suffering
a
child
or
a
greybeard
in
confidence
or
doubt
in
sleep
or
in
waking
i
am
it
i
am
the
true
man
but
if
i
am
man
and
have
really
found
in
myself
him
whom
religious
humanity
designated
as
the
distant
goal
then
everything
truly
human
is
also
my
own
what
was
ascribed
to
the
idea
of
humanity
belongs
to
me
that
freedom
of
trade
for
example
which
humanity
has
yet
to
attain
q
and
which
like
an
enchanting
dream
people
remove
to
humanitys
golden
future
q
i
take
by
anticipation
as
my
property
and
carry
it
on
for
the
time
in
the
form
of
smuggling
there
may
indeed
be
but
few
smugglers
who
have
sufficient
understanding
to
thus
account
to
themselves
for
their
doings
but
the
instinct
of
egoism
replaces
their
consciousness
above
i
have
shown
the
same
thing
about
freedom
of
the
press
everything
is
my
own
therefore
i
bring
back
to
myself
what
wants
to
withdraw
from
me
but
above
all
i
always
bring
myself
back
when
i
have
slipped
away
from
myself
to
any
tributariness
but
this
too
is
not
my
calling
but
my
natural
act
enough
there
is
a
mighty
difference
whether
i
make
myself
the
starting
point
or
the
goal
as
the
latter
i
do
not
have
myself
am
consequently
still
alien
to
myself
am
my
essence
my
true
essence
and
this
true
essence
alien
to
me
will
mock
me
as
a
spook
of
a
thousand
different
names
because
i
am
not
yet
i
another
like
god
the
true
man
the
truly
pious
man
the
rational
man
the
freeman
etc
is
i
my
ego
still
far
from
myself
i
separate
myself
into
two
halves
of
which
one
the
one
unattained
and
to
be
fulfilled
is
the
true
one
the
one
the
untrue
must
be
brought
as
a
sacrifice
to
wit
the
unspiritual
one
the
other
the
true
is
to
be
the
whole
man
to
wit
the
spirit
then
it
is
said
the
spirit
is
mans
proper
essence
or
man
exists
as
man
only
spiritually
now
there
is
a
greedy
rush
to
catch
the
spirit
as
if
one
would
then
have
bagged
himself
and
so
in
chasing
after
himself
one
loses
sight
of
himself
whom
he
is
and
as
one
stormily
pursues
his
own
self
the
never
attained
so
one
also
despises
shrewd
peoples
rule
to
take
men
as
they
are
and
prefers
to
take
them
as
they
should
be
and
for
this
reason
hounds
every
one
on
after
his
should
be
self
and
endeavours
to
make
all
into
equally
entitled
equally
respectable
equally
moral
or
rational
men

yes
if
men
were
what
they
should
be
could
be
if
all
men
were
rational
all
loved
each
other
as
brothers
then
it
would
be
a
paradisiacal
life

q
all
right
men
are
as
they
should
be
can
be
what
should
they
be
surely
not
more
than
they
can
be
and
what
can
they
be
not
more
again
than
they
can
than
they
have
the
competence
the
force
to
be
but
this
they
really
are
because
what
they
are
not
they
are
incapable
of
being
for
to
be
capable
means
q
really
to
be
one
is
not
capable
for
anything
that
one
really
is
not
one
is
not
capable
of
anything
that
one
does
not
really
do
could
a
man
blinded
by
cataract
see
oh
yes
if
he
had
his
cataract
successfully
removed
but
now
he
cannot
see
because
he
does
not
see
possibility
and
reality
always
coincide
one
can
do
nothing
that
one
does
not
as
one
does
nothing
that
one
cannot
the
singularity
of
this
assertion
vanishes
when
one
reflects
that
the
words
it
is
possible
that
almost
never
contain
another
meaning
than
i
can
imagine
that
for
instance
it
is
possible
for
all
men
to
live
rationally
that
is
i
can
imagine
that
all
etc
now
q
since
my
thinking
cannot
and
accordingly
does
not
cause
all
men
to
live
rationally
but
this
must
still
be
left
to
the
men
themselves
q
general
reason
is
for
me
only
thinkable
a
thinkableness
but
as
such
in
fact
a
reality
that
is
called
a
possibility
only
in
reference
to
what
i
can
not
bring
to
pass
to
wit
the
rationality
of
others
so
far
as
depends
on
you
all
men
might
be
rational
for
you
have
nothing
against
it
nay
so
far
as
your
thinking
reaches
you
perhaps
cannot
discover
any
hindrance
either
and
accordingly
nothing
does
stand
in
the
way
of
the
thing
in
your
thinking
it
is
thinkable
to
you
as
men
are
not
all
rational
though
it
is
probable
that
they
q
cannot
be
so
if
something
which
one
imagines
to
be
easily
possible
is
not
or
does
not
happen
then
one
may
be
assured
that
something
stands
in
the
way
of
the
thing
and
that
it
is
q
impossible
our
time
has
its
art
science
etc
the
art
may
be
bad
in
all
conscience
but
may
one
say
that
we
deserved
to
have
a
better
and
could
have
it
if
we
only
would
we
have
just
as
much
art
as
we
can
have
our
art
of
to
day
is
the
only
art
possible
and
therefore
real
at
the
time
even
in
the
sense
to
which
one
might
at
last
still
reduce
the
word
possible
that
it
should
mean
future
it
retains
the
full
force
of
the
real
if
one
says
it
is
possible
that
the
sun
will
rise
tomorrow
q
this
means
only
for
today
tomorrow
is
the
real
future
for
i
suppose
there
is
hardly
need
of
the
suggestion
that
a
future
is
real
future
only
when
it
has
not
yet
appeared
yet
wherefore
this
dignifying
of
a
word
if
the
most
prolific
misunderstanding
of
thousands
of
years
were
not
in
ambush
behind
it
if
this
single
concept
of
the
little
word
possible
were
not
haunted
by
all
the
spooks
of
possessed
men
its
contemplation
should
trouble
us
little
here
the
thought
it
was
just
now
shown
rules
the
possessed
world
well
then
possibility
is
nothing
but
thinkableness
and
innumerable
sacrifices
have
hitherto
been
made
to
hideous
thinkableness
it
was
thinkable
that
men
might
become
rational
thinkable
that
they
might
know
christ
thinkable
that
they
might
become
moral
and
enthusiastic
for
the
good
thinkable
that
they
might
all
take
refuge
in
the
churchs
lap
thinkable
that
they
might
meditate
speak
and
do
nothing
dangerous
to
the
state
thinkable
that
they
might
be
obedient
subjects
but
because
it
was
thinkable
it
was
q
so
ran
the
inference
q
possible
and
further
because
it
was
possible
to
men
right
here
lies
the
deceptive
point
because
it
is
thinkable
to
me
it
is
possible
to
men
therefore
they
ought
to
be
so
it
was
their
calling
and
finally
q
one
is
to
take
men
only
according
to
this
calling
only
as
called
men
not
as
they
are
but
as
they
ought
to
be
and
the
further
inference
man
is
not
the
individual
but
man
is
a
thought
an
ideal
to
which
the
individual
is
related
not
even
as
the
child
to
the
man
but
as
a
chalk
point
to
a
point
thought
of
or
as
a
q
finite
creature
to
the
eternal
creator
or
according
to
modern
views
as
the
specimen
to
the
species
here
then
comes
to
light
the
glorification
of
humanity
the
eternal
immortal
for
whose
glory
in
majorem
humanitatis
gloriam
the
individual
must
devote
himself
and
find
his
immortal
renown
in
having
done
something
for
the
spirit
of
humanity
thus
the
thinkers
rule
in
the
world
as
long
as
the
age
of
priests
or
of
schoolmasters
lasts
and
what
they
think
of
is
possible
but
what
is
possible
must
be
realized
they
think
an
ideal
of
man
which
for
the
time
is
real
only
in
their
thoughts
but
they
also
think
the
possibility
of
carrying
it
out
and
there
is
no
chance
for
dispute
the
carrying
out
is
really
q
thinkable
it
is
an
q
idea
but
you
and
i
we
may
indeed
be
people
of
whom
a
krummacher
can
think
that
we
might
yet
become
good
christians
if
however
he
wanted
to
labour
with
us
we
should
soon
make
it
palpable
to
him
that
our
christianity
is
only
thinkable
but
in
other
respects
impossible
if
he
grinned
on
and
on
at
us
with
his
obtrusive
thoughts
his
good
belief
he
would
have
to
learn
that
we
do
not
at
all
need
to
become
what
we
do
not
like
to
become
and
so
it
goes
on
far
beyond
the
most
pious
of
the
pious
if
all
men
were
rational
if
all
did
right
if
all
were
guided
by
philanthropy
etc
reason
right
philanthropy
are
put
before
the
eyes
of
men
as
their
calling
as
the
goal
of
their
aspiration
and
what
does
being
rational
mean
giving
oneself
a
hearing

no
reason
is
a
book
full
of
laws
which
are
all
enacted
against
egoism
history
hitherto
is
the
history
of
the
intellectual
man
after
the
period
of
sensuality
history
proper
begins
the
period
of
intellectuality

spirituality

non
sensuality
supersensuality
nonsensicality
man
now
begins
to
want
to
be
and
become
something
what
good
beautiful
true
more
precisely
moral
pious
agreeable
etc
he
wants
to
make
of
himself
a
proper
man
something
proper
man
is
his
goal
his
ought
his
destiny
calling
task
his
q
ideal
he
is
to
himself
a
future
otherworldly
he
and
what
makes
a
proper
fellow
of
him
being
true
being
good
being
moral
and
the
like
now
he
looks
askance
at
every
one
who
does
not
recognize
the
same
what
seek
the
same
morality
have
the
same
faith
he
chases
out
separatists
heretics
sects
etc
no
sheep
no
dog
exerts
itself
to
become
a
proper
sheep
a
proper
dog
no
beast
has
its
essence
appear
to
it
as
a
task
as
a
concept
that
it
has
to
realize
it
realizes
itself
in
living
itself
out
in
dissolving
itself
passing
away
it
does
not
ask
to
be
or
to
become
anything
other
than
it
is
do
i
mean
to
advise
you
to
be
like
the
beasts
that
you
ought
to
become
beasts
is
an
exhortation
which
i
certainly
cannot
give
you
as
that
would
again
be
a
task
an
ideal
how
doth
the
little
busy
bee
improve
each
shinin
g
hour
in
works
of
labour
or
of
skill
i
would
be
busy
too
for
satan
finds
some
mischief
still
for
idle
hands
to
do
it
would
be
the
same
too
as
if
one
wished
for
the
beasts
that
they
should
become
human
beings
your
nature
is
once
for
all
a
human
one
you
are
human
natures
human
beings
but
just
because
you
already
are
so
you
do
not
still
need
to
become
so
beasts
too
are
trained
and
a
trained
beast
executes
many
unnatural
things
but
a
trained
dog
is
no
better
for
itself
than
a
natural
one
and
has
no
profit
from
it
even
if
it
is
more
companionable
for
us
exertions
to
form
all
men
into
moral
rational
pious
human
beings
training
were
in
vogue
from
of
yore
they
are
wrecked
against
the
indomitable
quality
of
i
against
own
nature
against
egoism
those
who
are
trained
never
attain
their
ideal
and
only
profess
with
their
mouth
the
sublime
principles
or
make
a
profession
a
profession
of
faith
in
face
of
this
profession
they
must
in
life
acknowledge
themselves
sinners
altogether
and
they
fall
short
of
their
ideal
are
weak
men
and
bear
with
them
the
consciousness
of
human
weakness
it
is
different
if
you
do
not
chase
after
an
ideal
as
your
destiny
but
dissolve
yourself
as
time
dissolves
everything
the
dissolution
is
not
your
destiny
because
it
is
present
time
yet
the
culture
the
religiousness
of
men
has
assuredly
made
them
free
but
only
free
from
one
lord
to
lead
them
to
another
i
have
learned
by
religion
to
tame
my
appetite
i
break
the
worlds
resistance
by
the
cunning
that
is
put
in
my
hand
by
science
i
even
serve
no
man
i
am
no
mans
lackey
but
then
it
comes
you
must
obey
god
more
than
man
just
so
i
am
indeed
free
from
irrational
determination
by
my
impulses
but
obedient
to
the
master
reason
i
have
gained
spiritual
freedom
freedom
of
the
spirit
but
with
that
i
have
then
become
subject
to
that
very
spirit
the
spirit
gives
me
orders
reason
guides
me
they
are
my
leaders
and
commanders
the
rational
the
servants
of
the
spirit
rule
but
if
i
am
not
flesh
i
am
in
truth
not
spirit
either
freedom
of
the
spirit
is
servitude
of
me
because
i
am
more
than
spirit
or
flesh
without
doubt
culture
has
made
me
powerful
it
has
given
me
power
over
all
motives
over
the
impulses
of
my
nature
as
well
as
over
the
exactions
and
violences
of
the
world
i
know
and
have
gained
the
force
for
it
by
culture
that
i
need
not
let
myself
be
coerced
by
any
of
my
appetites
pleasures
emotions
etc
i
am
their
q
master
in
like
manner
i
become
through
the
sciences
and
arts
the
master
of
the
refractory
world
whom
sea
and
earth
obey
and
to
whom
even
the
stars
must
give
an
account
of
themselves
the
spirit
has
made
me
master
q
but
i
have
no
power
over
the
spirit
itself
from
religion
culture
i
do
learn
the
means
for
the
vanquishing
of
the
world
but
not
how
i
am
to
subdue
god
too
and
become
master
of
him
for
god
is
the
spirit
and
this
same
spirit
of
which
i
am
unable
to
become
master
may
have
the
most
manifold
shapes
he
may
be
called
god
or
national
spirit
state
family
reason
also
q
liberty
humanity
man
i
receive
with
thanks
what
the
centuries
of
culture
have
acquired
for
me
i
am
not
willing
to
throw
away
and
give
up
anything
of
it
i
have
not
lived
in
vain
the
experience
that
i
have
power
over
my
nature
and
need
not
be
the
slave
of
my
appetites
shall
not
be
lost
to
me
the
experience
that
i
can
subdue
the
world
by
cultures
means
is
too
dear
bought
for
me
to
be
able
to
forget
it
but
i
want
still
more
people
ask
what
can
man
do
what
can
he
accomplish
what
goods
procure
and
put
down
the
highest
of
everything
as
a
calling
as
if
everything
were
possible
to
me
if
one
sees
somebody
going
to
ruin
in
a
mania
a
passion
etc
as
in
the
huckster
spirit
in
jealousy
the
desire
is
stirred
to
deliver
him
out
of
this
possession
and
to
help
him
to
self
conquest
we
want
to
make
a
man
of
him

that
would
be
very
fine
if
another
possession
were
not
immediately
put
in
the
place
of
the
earlier
one
but
one
frees
from
the
love
of
money
him
who
is
a
thrall
to
it
only
to
deliver
him
over
to
piety
humanity
or
some
principle
else
and
to
transfer
him
to
a
fixed
stand
point
anew
this
transference
from
a
narrow
stand
point
to
a
sublime
one
is
declared
in
the
words
that
the
sense
must
not
be
directed
to
the
perishable
but
to
the
imperishable
alone
not
to
the
temporal
but
to
the
eternal
absolute
divine
purely
human
etc
q
to
the
spiritual
people
very
soon
discerned
that
it
was
not
indifferent
what
one
set
his
affections
on
or
what
one
occupied
himself
with
they
recognized
the
importance
of
the
object
an
object
exalted
above
the
individuality
of
things
is
the
essence
of
things
yes
the
essence
is
alone
the
thinkable
in
them
it
is
for
the
thinking
man
therefore
direct
no
longer
your
sense
to
the
things
but
your
thoughts
to
the
essence
blessed
are
they
who
see
not
and
yet
believe
that
is
blessed
are
the
thinkers
for
they
have
to
do
with
the
invisible
and
believe
in
it
yet
even
an
object
of
thought
that
constituted
an
essential
point
of
contention
centuries
long
comes
at
last
to
the
point
of
being
no
longer
worth
speaking
of
this
was
discerned
but
nevertheless
people
always
kept
before
their
eyes
again
a
self
valid
importance
of
the
object
an
absolute
value
of
it
as
if
the
doll
were
not
the
most
important
thing
to
the
child
the
koran
to
the
turk
as
long
as
i
am
not
the
sole
important
thing
to
myself
it
is
indifferent
of
what
object
i
make
much
and
only
my
greater
or
lesser
delinquency
against
it
is
of
value
the
degree
of
my
attachment
and
devotion
marks
the
stand
point
of
my
liability
to
service
the
degree
of
my
sinning
shows
the
measure
of
my
ownness
but
finally
and
in
general
one
must
know
how
to
put
everything
out
of
his
mind
if
only
so
as
to
be
able
to
q
go
to
sleep
nothing
may
occupy
us
with
which
we
do
not
occupy
ourselves
the
victim
of
ambition
cannot
run
away
from
his
ambitious
plans
nor
the
god
fearing
man
from
the
thought
of
god
infatuation
and
possessedness
coincide
to
want
to
realize
his
essence
or
live
comfortably
to
his
concept
which
with
believers
in
god
signifies
as
much
as
to
be
pious
and
with
believers
in
humanity
means
living
humanly
is
what
only
the
sensual
and
sinful
man
can
propose
to
himself
the
man
so
long
as
he
has
the
anxious
choice
between
happiness
of
sense
and
peace
of
soul
so
long
as
he
is
a
poor
sinner
the
christian
is
nothing
but
a
sensual
man
who
knowing
of
the
sacred
and
being
conscious
that
he
violates
it
sees
in
himself
a
poor
sinner
sensualness
recognized
as
sinfulness
is
christian
consciousness
is
the
christian
himself
and
if
sin
and
sinfulness
are
now
no
longer
taken
into
the
mouths
of
moderns
but
instead
of
that
egoism
self
seeking
selfishness
and
the
like
engage
them
if
the
devil
has
been
translated
into
the
un
man
or
egoistic
man
q
is
the
christian
less
present
then
than
before
is
not
the
old
discord
between
good
and
evil
q
is
not
a
judge
over
us
man
q
is
not
a
calling
the
calling
to
make
oneself
man
q
left
if
they
no
longer
name
it
calling
but
task
or
very
likely
duty
the
change
of
name
is
quite
correct
because
man
is
not
like
god
a
personal
being
that
can
call
but
outside
the
name
the
thing
remains
as
of
old

every
one
has
a
relation
to
objects
and
more
every
one
is
differently
related
to
them
let
us
choose
as
an
example
that
book
to
which
millions
of
men
had
a
relation
for
two
thousand
years
the
bible
what
is
it
what
was
it
to
each
absolutely
only
what
he
made
out
of
it
for
him
who
makes
to
himself
nothing
at
all
out
of
it
it
is
nothing
at
all
for
him
who
uses
it
as
an
amulet
it
has
solely
the
value
the
significance
of
a
means
of
sorcery
for
him
who
like
children
plays
with
it
it
is
nothing
but
a
plaything
etc
now
christianity
asks
that
it
shall
be
the
same
for
all
say
the
sacred
book
or
the
sacred
scriptures
this
means
as
much
as
that
the
christians
view
shall
also
be
that
of
other
men
and
that
no
one
may
be
otherwise
related
to
that
object
and
with
this
the
ownness
of
the
relation
is
destroyed
and
one
mind
one
disposition
is
fixed
as
the
true
the
only
true
one
in
the
limitation
of
the
freedom
to
make
of
the
bible
what
i
will
the
freedom
of
making
in
general
is
limited
and
the
coercion
of
a
view
or
a
judgment
is
put
in
its
place
he
who
should
pass
the
judgment
that
the
bible
was
a
long
error
of
mankind
would
judge
q
criminally
in
fact
the
child
who
tears
it
to
pieces
or
plays
with
it
the
inca
atahualpa
who
lays
his
ear
to
it
and
throws
it
away
contemptuously
when
it
remains
dumb
judges
just
as
correctly
about
the
bible
as
the
priest
who
praises
in
it
the
word
of
god
or
the
critic
who
calls
it
a
job
of
mens
hands
for
how
we
toss
things
about
is
the
affair
of
our
option
our
free
will
we
use
them
according
to
our
hearts
pleasure
or
more
clearly
we
use
them
just
as
we
can
why
what
do
the
parsons
scream
about
when
they
see
how
hegel
and
the
speculative
theologians
make
speculative
thoughts
out
of
the
contents
of
the
bible
precisely
this
that
they
deal
with
it
according
to
their
hearts
pleasure
or
proceed
arbitrarily
with
it
but
because
we
all
show
ourselves
arbitrary
in
the
handling
of
objects
that
is
do
with
them
as
we
like
best
at
our
liking
the
philosopher
likes
nothing
so
well
as
when
he
can
trace
out
an
idea
in
everything
as
the
god
fearing
man
likes
to
make
god
his
friend
by
everything
and
so
for
example
by
keeping
the
bible
sacred
therefore
we
nowhere
meet
such
grievous
arbitrariness
such
a
frightful
tendency
to
violence
such
stupid
coercion
as
in
this
very
domain
of
our
q
own
free
will
if
we
proceed
arbitrarily
in
taking
the
sacred
objects
thus
or
so
how
is
it
then
that
we
want
to
take
it
ill
of
the
parson
spirits
if
they
take
us
just
as
arbitrarily
in
their
fashion
and
esteem
us
worthy
of
the
heretics
fire
or
of
another
punishment
perhaps
of
the
q
censorship
what
a
man
is
he
makes
out
of
things
as
you
look
at
the
world
so
it
looks
at
you
again
then
the
wise
advice
makes
itself
heard
again
at
once
you
must
only
look
at
it
rightly
unbiasedly
etc
as
if
the
child
did
not
look
at
the
bible
rightly
and
unbiasedly
when
it
makes
it
a
plaything
that
shrewd
precept
is
given
us
by
feuerbach
one
does
look
at
things
rightly
when
one
makes
of
them
what
one
will
by
things
objects
in
general
are
here
understood
such
as
god
our
fellowmen
a
sweetheart
a
book
a
beast
etc
and
therefore
the
things
and
the
looking
at
them
are
not
first
but
i
am
my
will
is
one
will
brings
thoughts
out
of
the
things
will
discover
reason
in
the
world
will
have
sacredness
in
it
therefore
one
shall
find
them
seek
and
ye
shall
find
what
i
will
seek
i
determine
i
want
for
example
to
get
edification
from
the
bible
it
is
to
be
found
i
want
to
read
and
test
the
bible
thoroughly
my
outcome
will
be
a
thorough
instruction
and
criticism
q
to
the
extent
of
my
powers
i
elect
for
myself
what
i
have
a
fancy
for
and
in
electing
i
show
myself
q
arbitrary
connected
with
this
is
the
discernment
that
every
judgment
which
i
pass
upon
an
object
is
the
creature
of
my
will
and
that
discernment
again
leads
me
to
not
losing
myself
in
the
creature
the
judgment
but
remaining
the
creator
the
judger
who
is
ever
creating
anew
all
predicates
of
objects
are
my
statements
my
judgments
my
q
creatures
if
they
want
to
tear
themselves
loose
from
me
and
be
something
for
themselves
or
actually
overawe
me
then
i
have
nothing
more
pressing
to
do
than
to
take
them
back
into
their
nothing
into
me
the
creator
god
christ
trinity
morality
the
good
etc
are
such
creatures
of
which
i
must
not
merely
allow
myself
to
say
that
they
are
truths
but
also
that
they
are
deceptions
as
i
once
willed
and
decreed
their
existence
so
i
want
to
have
license
to
will
their
non
existence
too
i
must
not
let
them
grow
over
my
head
must
not
have
the
weakness
to
let
them
become
something
absolute
whereby
they
would
be
eternalized
and
withdrawn
from
my
power
and
decision
with
that
i
should
fall
a
prey
to
the
principle
of
stability
the
proper
life
principle
of
religion
which
concerns
itself
with
creating
sanctuaries
that
must
not
be
touched
eternal
truths
q
in
short
that
which
shall
be
sacred
q
and
depriving
you
of
what
is
yours
the
object
makes
us
into
possessed
men
in
its
sacred
form
just
as
in
its
profane
as
a
supersensuous
object
just
as
it
does
as
a
sensuous
one
the
appetite
or
mania
refers
to
both
and
avarice
and
longing
for
heaven
stand
on
a
level
when
the
rationalists
wanted
to
win
people
for
the
sensuous
world
lavater
preached
the
longing
for
the
invisible
the
one
party
wanted
to
call
forth
emotion
the
other
motion
activity
the
conception
of
objects
is
altogether
diverse
even
as
god
christ
the
world
were
and
are
conceived
of
in
the
most
manifold
wise
in
this
every
one
is
a
dissenter
and
after
bloody
combats
so
much
has
at
last
been
attained
that
opposite
views
about
one
and
the
same
object
are
no
longer
condemned
as
heresies
worthy
of
death
the
dissenters
reconcile
themselves
to
each
other
but
why
should
i
only
dissent
think
otherwise
about
a
thing
why
not
push
the
thinking
otherwise
to
its
last
extremity
that
of
no
longer
having
any
regard
at
all
for
the
thing
and
therefore
thinking
its
nothingness
crushing
it
then
the
conception
itself
has
an
end
because
there
is
no
longer
anything
to
conceive
of
why
am
i
to
say
let
us
suppose
god
is
not
allah
not
brahma
not
jehovah
but
q
god
but
not
god
is
nothing
but
a
deception
why
do
people
brand
me
if
i
am
an
atheist
because
they
put
the
creature
above
the
creator
they
honour
and
serve
the
creature
more
than
the
creator

and
require
a
ruling
object
that
the
subject
may
be
right
submissive
i
am
to
bend
beneath
the
absolute
i
ought
to
by
the
realm
of
thoughts
christianity
has
completed
itself
the
thought
is
that
inwardness
in
which
all
the
worlds
lights
go
out
all
existence
becomes
existenceless
the
inward
man
the
heart
the
head
is
all
in
all
this
realm
of
thoughts
awaits
its
deliverance
awaits
like
the
sphinx
oedipuss
key
word
to
the
riddle
that
it
may
enter
in
at
last
to
its
death
i
am
the
annihilator
of
its
continuance
for
in
the
creators
realm
it
no
longer
forms
a
realm
of
its
own
not
a
state
in
the
state
but
a
creature
of
my
creative
q
thoughtlessness
only
together
and
at
the
same
time
with
the
benumbed
thinking
world
can
the
world
of
christians
christianity
and
religion
itself
come
to
its
downfall
only
when
thoughts
run
out
are
there
no
more
believers
to
the
thinker
his
thinking
is
a
sublime
labour
a
sacred
activity
and
it
rests
on
a
firm
faith
the
faith
in
truth
at
first
praying
is
a
sacred
activity
then
this
sacred
devotion
passes
over
into
a
rational
and
reasoning
thinking
which
however
likewise
retains
in
the
sacred
truth
its
underangeable
basis
of
faith
and
is
only
a
marvellous
machine
that
the
spirit
of
truth
winds
up
for
its
service
free
thinking
and
free
science
busy
me
q
for
it
is
not
i
that
am
free
not
i
that
busy
myself
but
thinking
is
free
and
busies
me
q
with
heaven
and
the
heavenly
or
divine
that
is
properly
with
the
world
and
the
worldly
not
this
world
but
another
world
it
is
only
the
reversing
and
deranging
of
the
world
a
busying
with
the
essence
of
the
world
therefore
a
derangement
the
thinker
is
blind
to
the
immediateness
of
things
and
incapable
of
mastering
them
he
does
not
eat
does
not
drink
does
not
enjoy
for
the
eater
and
drinker
is
never
the
thinker
nay
the
latter
forgets
eating
and
drinking
his
getting
on
in
life
the
cares
of
nourishment
etc
over
his
thinking
he
forgets
it
as
the
praying
man
too
forgets
it
this
is
why
he
appears
to
the
forceful
son
of
nature
as
a
queer
dick
a
fool
q
even
if
he
does
look
upon
him
as
holy
just
as
lunatics
appeared
so
to
the
ancients
free
thinking
is
lunacy
because
it
is
pure
movement
of
the
inwardness
of
the
merely
inward
man
which
guides
and
regulates
the
rest
of
the
man
the
shaman
and
the
speculative
philosopher
mark
the
bottom
and
top
rounds
on
the
ladder
of
the
inward
man
the
q
mongol
shaman
and
philosopher
fight
with
ghosts
demons
spirits
gods
totally
different
from
this
free
thinking
is
own
thinking
my
thinking
a
thinking
which
does
not
guide
me
but
is
guided
continued
or
broken
off
by
me
at
my
pleasure
the
distinction
of
this
own
thinking
from
free
thinking
is
similar
to
that
of
own
sensuality
which
i
satisfy
at
pleasure
from
free
unruly
sensuality
to
which
i
succumb
feuerbach
in
the
principles
of
the
philosophy
of
the
future

is
always
harping
upon
being
in
this
he
too
with
all
his
antagonism
to
hegel
and
the
absolute
philosophy
is
stuck
fast
in
abstraction
for
being
is
abstraction
as
is
even
the
i
only
i
am
not
abstraction
alone
i
am
all
in
all
consequently
even
abstraction
or
nothing
i
am
all
and
nothing
i
am
not
a
mere
thought
but
at
the
same
time
i
am
full
of
thoughts
a
thoughtworld
hegel
condemns
the
own
mine
q
opinion

absolute
thinking
is
that
which
forgets
that
it
is
my
thinking
that
i
think
and
that
it
exists
only
through
me
but
i
as
i
swallow
up
again
what
is
mine
am
its
master
it
is
only
my
opinion
which
i
can
at
any
moment
change
annihilate
take
back
into
myself
and
consume
feuerbach
wants
to
smite
hegels
absolute
thinking
with
unconquered
being
but
in
me
being
is
as
much
conquered
as
thinking
is
it
is
my
being
as
the
other
is
my
thinking
with
this
of
course
feuerbach
does
not
get
further
than
to
the
proof
trivial
in
itself
that
i
require
the
senses
for
everything
or
that
i
cannot
entirely
do
without
these
organs
certainly
i
cannot
think
if
i
do
not
exist
sensuously
but
for
thinking
as
well
as
for
feeling
and
so
for
the
abstract
as
well
as
for
the
sensuous
i
need
above
all
things
myself
this
quite
particular
myself
this
unique
myself
if
i
were
not
this
one
for
instance
hegel
i
should
not
look
at
the
world
as
i
do
look
at
it
i
should
not
pick
out
of
it
that
philosophical
system
which
just
i
as
hegel
do
etc
i
should
indeed
have
senses
as
do
other
people
too
but
i
should
not
utilize
them
as
i
do
thus
the
reproach
is
brought
up
against
hegel
by
feuerbach
that
he
misuses
language
understanding
by
many
words
something
else
than
what
natural
consciousness
takes
them
for
and
yet
he
too
commits
the
same
fault
when
he
gives
the
sensuous
a
sense
of
unusual
eminence
thus
it
is
said
p

the
sensuous
is
not
the
profane
the
destitute
of
thought
the
obvious
that
which
is
understood
of
itself
but
if
it
is
the
sacred
the
full
of
thought
the
recondite
that
which
can
be
understood
only
through
mediation
q
well
then
it
is
no
longer
what
people
call
the
sensuous
the
sensuous
is
only
that
which
exists
for
the
senses
what
on
the
other
hand
is
enjoyable
only
to
those
who
enjoy
with
more
than
the
senses
who
go
beyond
sense
enjoyment
or
sense
reception
is
at
most
mediated
or
introduced
by
the
senses
that
is
the
senses
constitute
a
condition
for
obtaining
it
but
it
is
no
longer
anything
sensuous
the
sensuous
whatever
it
may
be
when
taken
up
into
me
becomes
something
non
sensuous
which
however
may
again
have
sensuous
effects
as
by
the
stirring
of
my
emotions
and
my
blood
it
is
well
that
feuerbach
brings
sensuousness
to
honour
but
the
only
thing
he
is
able
to
do
with
it
is
to
clothe
the
materialism
of
his
new
philosophy
with
what
had
hitherto
been
the
property
of
idealism
the
absolute
philosophy
as
little
as
people
let
it
be
talked
into
them
that
one
can
live
on
the
spiritual
alone
without
bread
so
little
will
they
believe
his
word
that
as
a
sensuous
being
one
is
already
everything
and
so
spiritual
full
of
thoughts
etc
nothing
at
all
is
justified
by
being
what
is
thought
of
is
as
well
as
what
is
not
thought
of
the
stone
in
the
street
is
and
my
notion
of
it
is
too
both
are
only
in
different
spaces
the
former
in
airy
space
the
latter
in
my
head
in
me
for
i
am
space
like
the
street
the
professionals
the
privileged
brook
no
freedom
of
thought
no
thoughts
that
do
not
come
from
the
giver
of
all
good
be
he
called
god
pope
church
or
whatever
else
if
anybody
has
such
illegitimate
thoughts
he
must
whisper
them
into
his
confessors
ear
and
have
himself
chastised
by
him
till
the
slave
whip
becomes
unendurable
to
the
free
thoughts
in
other
ways
too
the
professional
spirit
takes
care
that
free
thoughts
shall
not
come
at
all
first
and
foremost
by
a
wise
education
he
on
whom
the
principles
of
morality
have
been
duly
inculcated
never
becomes
free
again
from
moralizing
thoughts
and
robbery
perjury
overreaching
and
the
like
remain
to
him
fixed
ideas
against
which
no
freedom
of
thought
protects
him
he
has
his
thoughts
from
above
and
gets
no
further
it
is
different
with
the
holders
of
concessions
or
patents
every
one
must
be
able
to
have
and
form
thoughts
as
he
will
if
he
has
the
patent
or
the
concession
of
a
capacity
to
think
he
needs
no
special
privilege
but
as
all
men
are
rational
it
is
free
to
every
one
to
put
into
his
head
any
thoughts
whatever
and
to
the
extent
of
the
patent
of
his
natural
endowment
to
have
a
greater
or
less
wealth
of
thoughts
now
one
hears
the
admonitions
that
one
is
to
honour
all
opinions
and
convictions
that
every
conviction
is
authorized
that
one
must
be
tolerant
to
the
views
of
others
etc
but
your
thoughts
are
not
my
thoughts
and
your
ways
are
not
my
ways
or
rather
i
mean
the
reverse
your
thoughts
are
my
thoughts
which
i
dispose
of
as
i
will
and
which
i
strike
down
unmercifully
they
are
my
property
which
i
annihilate
as
i
list
i
do
not
wait
for
authorization
from
you
first
to
decompose
and
blow
away
your
thoughts
it
does
not
matter
to
me
that
you
call
these
thoughts
yours
too
they
remain
mine
nevertheless
and
how
i
will
proceed
with
them
is
my
affair
not
a
usurpation
it
may
please
me
to
leave
you
in
your
thoughts
then
i
keep
still
do
you
believe
thoughts
fly
around
free
like
birds
so
that
every
one
may
get
himself
some
which
he
may
then
make
good
against
me
as
his
inviolable
property
what
is
flying
around
is
all
q
mine
do
you
believe
you
have
your
thoughts
for
yourselves
and
need
answer
to
no
one
for
them
or
as
you
do
also
say
you
have
to
give
an
account
of
them
to
god
only
no
your
great
and
small
thoughts
belong
to
me
and
i
handle
them
at
my
pleasure
the
thought
is
my
own
only
when
i
have
no
misgiving
about
bringing
it
in
danger
of
death
every
moment
when
i
do
not
have
to
fear
its
loss
as
a
loss
for
me
a
loss
of
me
the
thought
is
my
own
only
when
i
can
indeed
subjugate
it
but
it
never
can
subjugate
me
never
fanaticizes
me
makes
me
the
tool
of
its
realization
so
freedom
of
thought
exists
when
i
can
have
all
possible
thoughts
but
the
thoughts
become
property
only
by
not
being
able
to
become
masters
in
the
time
of
freedom
of
thought
thoughts
ideas
rule
but
if
i
attain
to
property
in
thought
they
stand
as
my
creatures
if
the
hierarchy
had
not
so
penetrated
men
to
the
innermost
as
to
take
from
them
all
courage
to
pursue
free
thoughts
that
is
thoughts
perhaps
displeasing
to
god
one
would
have
to
consider
freedom
of
thought
just
as
empty
a
word
as
say
a
freedom
of
digestion
according
to
the
professionals
opinion
the
thought
is
given
to
me
according
to
the
freethinkers
i
seek
the
thought
there
the
truth
is
already
found
and
extant
only
i
must
q
receive
it
from
its
giver
by
grace
here
the
truth
is
to
be
sought
and
is
my
goal
lying
in
the
future
toward
which
i
have
to
run
in
both
cases
the
truth
the
true
thought
lies
outside
me
and
i
aspire
to
get
it
be
it
by
presentation
grace
be
it
by
earning
merit
of
my
own
therefore

the
truth
is
a
privilege

no
the
way
to
it
is
patent
to
all
and
neither
the
bible
nor
the
holy
fathers
nor
the
church
nor
any
one
else
is
in
possession
of
the
truth
but
one
can
come
into
possession
of
it
by
q
speculating
both
one
sees
are
property
less
in
relation
to
the
truth
they
have
it
either
as
a
fief
for
the
holy
father
is
not
a
unique
person
as
unique
he
is
this
sixtus
clement
but
he
does
not
have
the
truth
as
sixtus
clement
but
as
holy
father
that
is
as
a
spirit
or
as
an
ideal
as
a
fief
it
is
only
for
a
few
the
privileged
as
an
ideal
for
all
the
patentees
freedom
of
thought
then
has
the
meaning
that
we
do
indeed
all
walk
in
the
dark
and
in
the
paths
of
error
but
every
one
can
on
this
path
approach
the
truth
and
is
accordingly
on
the
right
path
all
roads
lead
to
rome
to
the
worlds
end
etc
hence
freedom
of
thought
means
this
much
that
the
true
thought
is
not
my
own
for
if
it
were
this
how
should
people
want
to
shut
me
off
from
it
thinking
has
become
entirely
free
and
has
laid
down
a
lot
of
truths
which
i
must
accommodate
myself
to
it
seeks
to
complete
itself
into
a
system
and
to
bring
itself
to
an
absolute
constitution
in
the
state
it
seeks
for
the
idea
say
till
it
has
brought
out
the
rational
state
in
which
i
am
then
obliged
to
be
suited
in
man
anthropology
till
it
has
found
man
the
thinker
is
distinguished
from
the
believer
only
by
believing
much
more
than
the
latter
who
on
his
part
thinks
of
much
less
as
signified
by
his
faith
creed
the
thinker
has
a
thousand
tenets
of
faith
where
the
believer
gets
along
with
few
but
the
former
brings
coherence
into
his
tenets
and
takes
the
coherence
in
turn
for
the
scale
to
estimate
their
worth
by
if
one
or
the
other
does
not
fit
into
his
budget
he
throws
it
out
the
thinkers
run
parallel
to
the
believers
in
their
pronouncements
instead
of
if
it
is
from
god
you
will
not
root
it
out
the
word
is
if
it
is
from
the
truth
is
true
etc
instead
of
give
god
the
glory
q
give
truth
the
glory
but
it
is
very
much
the
same
to
me
whether
god
or
the
truth
wins
first
and
foremost
i
want
to
win
aside
from
this
how
is
an
unlimited
freedom
to
be
thinkable
inside
of
the
state
or
society
the
state
may
well
protect
one
against
another
but
yet
it
must
not
let
itself
be
endangered
by
an
unmeasured
freedom
a
so
called
unbridleness
thus
in
freedom
of
instruction
the
state
declares
only
this
q
that
it
is
suited
with
every
one
who
instructs
as
the
state
or
speaking
more
comprehensibly
the
political
power
would
have
it
the
point
for
the
competitors
is
this
as
the
state
would
have
it
if
the
clergy
for
example
does
not
will
as
the
state
does
then
it
itself
excludes
itself
from
competition
vide
france
the
limit
that
is
necessarily
drawn
in
the
state
for
any
and
all
competition
is
called
the
oversight
and
superintendence
of
the
state
in
bidding
freedom
of
instruction
keep
within
the
due
bounds
the
state
at
the
same
time
fixes
the
scope
of
freedom
of
thought
because
as
a
rule
people
do
not
think
farther
than
their
teachers
have
thought
hear
minister
guizot

the
great
difficulty
of
today
is
the
guiding
and
dominating
of
the
mind
formerly
the
church
fulfilled
this
mission
now
it
is
not
adequate
to
it
it
is
from
the
university
that
this
great
service
must
be
expected
and
the
university
will
not
fail
to
perform
it
we
the
government
have
the
duty
of
supporting
it
therein
the
charter
calls
for
the
freedom
of
thought
and
that
of
conscience

so
in
favour
of
freedom
of
thought
and
conscience
the
minister
demands
the
guiding
and
dominating
of
the
mind
catholicism
haled
the
examinee
before
the
forum
of
ecclesiasticism
protestantism
before
that
of
biblical
christianity
it
would
be
but
little
bettered
if
one
haled
him
before
that
of
reason
as
ruge
wants
to

whether
the
church
the
bible
or
reason
to
which
moreover
luther
and
hus
already
appealed
is
the
sacred
authority
makes
no
difference
in
essentials
the
question
of
our
time
does
not
become
soluble
even
when
one
puts
it
thus
is
anything
general
authorized
or
only
the
individual
is
the
generality
such
as
state
law
custom
morality
etc
authorized
or
individuality
it
becomes
soluble
for
the
first
time
when
one
no
longer
asks
after
an
authorization
at
all
and
does
not
carry
on
a
mere
fight
against
privileges
q
a
rational
freedom
of
teaching
which
recognizes
only
the
conscience
of
reason

does
not
bring
us
to
the
goal
we
require
an
egoistic
freedom
of
teaching
rather
a
freedom
of
teaching
for
all
ownness
wherein
i
become
audible
and
can
announce
myself
unchecked
that
i
make
myself
audible

this
alone
is
reason

be
i
ever
so
irrational
in
my
making
myself
heard
and
so
hearing
myself
others
as
well
as
i
myself
enjoy
me
and
at
the
same
time
consume
me
what
would
be
gained
if
as
formerly
the
orthodox
i
the
loyal
i
the
moral
i
etc
was
free
now
the
rational
i
should
become
free
would
this
be
the
freedom
of
me
if
i
am
free
as
rational
i
then
the
rational
in
me
or
reason
is
free
and
this
freedom
of
reason
or
freedom
of
the
thought
was
the
ideal
of
the
christian
world
from
of
old
they
wanted
to
make
thinking
q
and
as
aforesaid
faith
is
also
thinking
as
thinking
is
faith
q
free
the
thinkers
the
believers
as
well
as
the
rational
were
to
be
free
for
the
rest
freedom
was
impossible
but
the
freedom
of
thinkers
is
the
freedom
of
the
children
of
god
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
merciless
q
hierarchy
or
dominion
of
the
thought
for
i
succumb
to
the
thought
if
thoughts
are
free
i
am
their
slave
i
have
no
power
over
them
and
am
dominated
by
them
but
i
want
to
have
the
thought
want
to
be
full
of
thoughts
but
at
the
same
time
i
want
to
be
thoughtless
and
instead
of
freedom
of
thought
i
preserve
for
myself
thoughtlessness
if
the
point
is
to
have
myself
understood
and
to
make
communications
then
assuredly
i
can
make
use
only
of
human
means
which
are
at
my
command
because
i
am
at
the
same
time
man
and
really
i
have
thoughts
only
as
man
as
i
i
am
at
the
same
time
thoughtless

he
who
cannot
get
rid
of
a
thought
is
so
far
only
man
is
a
thrall
of
language
this
human
institution
this
treasury
of
human
thoughts
language
or
the
word
tyrannizes
hardest
over
us
because
it
brings
up
against
us
a
whole
army
of
fixed
ideas
just
observe
yourself
in
the
act
of
reflection
right
now
and
you
will
find
how
you
make
progress
only
by
becoming
thoughtless
and
speechless
every
moment
you
are
not
thoughtless
and
speechless
merely
in
say
sleep
but
even
in
the
deepest
reflection
yes
precisely
then
most
so
and
only
by
this
thoughtlessness
this
unrecognized
freedom
of
thought
or
freedom
from
the
thought
are
you
your
own
only
from
it
do
you
arrive
at
putting
language
to
use
as
your
property
if
thinking
is
not
my
thinking
it
is
merely
a
spun
out
thought
it
is
slave
work
or
the
work
of
a
servant
obeying
at
the
word
for
not
a
thought
but
i
am
the
beginning
for
my
thinking
and
therefore
i
am
its
goal
too
even
as
its
whole
course
is
only
a
course
of
my
self
enjoyment
for
absolute
or
free
thinking
on
the
other
hand
thinking
itself
is
the
beginning
and
it
plagues
itself
with
propounding
this
beginning
as
the
extremest
abstraction
such
as
being
this
very
abstraction
or
this
thought
is
then
spun
out
further
absolute
thinking
is
the
affair
of
the
human
spirit
and
this
is
a
holy
spirit
hence
this
thinking
is
an
affair
of
the
parsons
who
have
a
sense
for
it
a
sense
for
the
highest
interests
of
mankind
for
the
spirit
to
the
believer
truths
are
a
settled
thing
a
fact
to
the
freethinker
a
thing
that
is
still
to
be
settled
be
absolute
thinking
ever
so
unbelieving
its
incredulity
has
its
limits
and
there
does
remain
a
belief
in
the
truth
in
the
spirit
in
the
idea
and
its
final
victory
this
thinking
does
not
sin
against
the
holy
spirit
but
all
thinking
that
does
not
sin
against
the
holy
spirit
is
belief
in
spirits
or
ghosts
i
can
as
little
renounce
thinking
as
feeling
the
spirits
activity
as
little
as
the
activity
of
the
senses
as
feeling
is
our
sense
for
things
so
thinking
is
our
sense
for
essences
thoughts
essences
have
their
existence
in
everything
sensuous
especially
in
the
word
the
power
of
words
follows
that
of
things
first
one
is
coerced
by
the
rod
afterward
by
conviction
the
might
of
things
overcomes
our
courage
our
spirit
against
the
power
of
a
conviction
and
so
of
the
word
even
the
rack
and
the
sword
lose
their
overpoweringness
and
force
the
men
of
conviction
are
the
priestly
men
who
resist
every
enticement
of
satan
christianity
took
away
from
the
things
of
this
world
only
their
irresistible
ness
made
us
independent
of
them
in
like
manner
i
raise
myself
above
truths
and
their
power
as
i
am
supersensual
so
i
am
supertrue
before
me
truths
are
as
common
and
as
indifferent
as
things
they
do
not
carry
me
away
and
do
not
inspire
me
with
enthusiasm
there
exists
not
even
one
truth
not
right
not
freedom
humanity
etc
that
has
stability
before
me
and
to
which
i
subject
myself
they
are
words
nothing
but
words
as
all
things
are
to
the
christian
nothing
but
vain
things
in
words
and
truths
every
word
is
a
truth
as
hegel
asserts
that
one
cannot
tell
a
lie
there
is
no
salvation
for
me
as
little
as
there
is
for
the
christian
in
things
and
vanities
as
the
riches
of
this
world
do
not
make
me
happy
so
neither
do
its
truths
it
is
now
no
longer
satan
but
the
spirit
that
plays
the
story
of
the
temptation
and
he
does
not
seduce
by
the
things
of
this
world
but
by
its
thoughts
by
the
glitter
of
the
idea
along
with
worldly
goods
all
sacred
goods
too
must
be
put
away
as
no
longer
valuable
truths
are
phrases
ways
of
speaking
words
logoz
brought
into
connection
or
into
an
articulate
series
they
form
logic
science
philosophy
for
thinking
and
speaking
i
need
truths
and
words
as
i
do
foods
for
eating
without
them
i
cannot
think
nor
speak
truths
are
mens
thoughts
set
down
in
words
and
therefore
just
as
extant
as
other
things
although
extant
only
for
the
mind
or
for
thinking
they
are
human
institutions
and
human
creatures
and
even
if
they
are
given
out
for
divine
revelations
there
still
remains
in
them
the
quality
of
alienness
for
me
yes
as
my
own
creatures
they
are
already
alienated
from
me
after
the
act
of
creation
the
christian
man
is
the
man
with
faith
in
thinking
who
believes
in
the
supreme
dominion
of
thoughts
and
wants
to
bring
thoughts
so
called
principles
to
dominion
many
a
one
does
indeed
test
the
thoughts
and
chooses
none
of
them
for
his
master
without
criticism
but
in
this
he
is
like
the
dog
who
sniffs
at
people
to
smell
out
his
master
he
is
always
aiming
at
the
ruling
thought
the
christian
may
reform
and
revolt
an
infinite
deal
may
demolish
the
ruling
concepts
of
centuries
he
will
always
aspire
to
a
new
principle
or
new
master
again
always
set
up
a
higher
or
deeper
truth
again
always
call
forth
a
cult
again
always
proclaim
a
spirit
called
to
dominion
lay
down
a
law
for
all
if
there
is
even
one
truth
only
to
which
man
has
to
devote
his
life
and
his
powers
because
he
is
man
then
he
is
subjected
to
a
rule
dominion
law
he
is
a
servingman
it
is
supposed
that
man
humanity
liberty
etc
are
such
truths
on
the
other
hand
one
can
say
thus
whether
you
will
further
occupy
yourself
with
thinking
depends
on
you
only
know
that
if
in
your
thinking
you
would
like
to
make
out
anything
worthy
of
notice
many
hard
problems
are
to
be
solved
without
vanquishing
which
you
cannot
get
far
there
exists
therefore
no
duty
and
no
calling
for
you
to
meddle
with
thoughts
ideas
truths
but
if
you
will
do
so
you
will
do
well
to
utilize
what
the
forces
of
others
have
already
achieved
toward
clearing
up
these
difficult
subjects
thus
therefore
he
who
will
think
does
assuredly
have
a
task
which
he
consciously
or
unconsciously
sets
for
himself
in
willing
that
but
no
one
has
the
task
of
thinking
or
of
believing
in
the
former
case
it
may
be
said
you
do
not
go
far
enough
you
have
a
narrow
and
biased
interest
you
do
not
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
thing
in
short
you
do
not
completely
subdue
it
but
on
the
other
hand
however
far
you
may
come
at
any
time
you
are
still
always
at
the
end
you
have
no
call
to
step
farther
and
you
can
have
it
as
you
will
or
as
you
are
able
it
stands
with
this
as
with
any
other
piece
of
work
which
you
can
give
up
when
the
humour
for
it
wears
off
just
so
if
you
can
no
longer
believe
a
thing
you
do
not
have
to
force
yourself
into
faith
or
to
busy
yourself
lastingly
as
if
with
a
sacred
truth
of
the
faith
as
theologians
or
philosophers
do
but
you
can
tranquilly
draw
back
your
interest
from
it
and
let
it
run
priestly
spirits
will
indeed
expound
this
your
lack
of
interest
as
laziness
thoughtlessness
obduracy
self
deception
and
the
like
but
do
you
just
let
the
trumpery
lie
notwithstanding
no
thing

no
so
called
highest
interest
of
mankind
no
sacred
cause

is
worth
your
serving
it
and
occupying
yourself
with
it
for
its
sake
you
may
seek
its
worth
in
this
alone
whether
it
is
worth
anything
to
you
for
your
sake
become
like
children
the
biblical
saying
admonishes
us
but
children
have
no
sacred
interest
and
know
nothing
of
a
good
cause
they
know
all
the
more
accurately
what
they
have
a
fancy
for
and
they
think
over
to
the
best
of
their
powers
how
they
are
to
arrive
at
it
thinking
will
as
little
cease
as
feeling
but
the
power
of
thoughts
and
ideas
the
dominion
of
theories
and
principles
the
sovereignty
of
the
spirit
in
short
the
q
hierarchy
lasts
as
long
as
the
parsons
that
is
theologians
philosophers
statesmen
philistines
liberals
schoolmasters
servants
parents
children
married
couples
proudhon
george
sand

bluntschli

and
others
have
the
floor
the
hierarchy
will
endure
as
long
as
people
believe
in
think
of
or
even
criticize
principles
for
even
the
most
inexorable
criticism
which
undermines
all
current
principles
still
does
finally
believe
in
the
principle
every
one
criticizes
but
the
criterion
is
different
people
run
after
the
right
criterion
the
right
criterion
is
the
first
presupposition
the
critic
starts
from
a
proposition
a
truth
a
belief
this
is
not
a
creation
of
the
critic
but
of
the
dogmatist
nay
commonly
it
is
actually
taken
up
out
of
the
culture
of
the
time
without
further
ceremony
like
liberty
humanity
etc
the
critic
has
not
discovered
man
but
this
truth
has
been
established
as
man
by
the
dogmatist
and
the
critic
who
besides
may
be
the
same
person
with
him
believes
in
this
truth
this
article
of
faith
in
this
faith
and
possessed
by
this
faith
he
criticizes
the
secret
of
criticism
is
some
truth
or
other
this
remains
its
energizing
mystery
but
i
distinguish
between
servile
and
own
criticism
if
i
criticize
under
the
presupposition
of
a
supreme
being
my
criticism
serves
the
being
and
is
carried
on
for
its
sake
if
i
am
possessed
by
the
belief
in
a
free
state
then
everything
that
has
a
bearing
on
it
i
criticize
from
the
stand
point
of
whether
it
is
suitable
to
this
state
for
i
love
this
state
if
i
criticize
as
a
pious
man
then
for
me
everything
falls
into
the
classes
of
divine
and
diabolical
and
before
my
criticism
nature
consists
of
traces
of
god
or
traces
of
the
devil
hence
names
like
godsgift
godmount
the
devils
pulpit
men
of
believers
and
unbelievers
if
i
criticize
while
believing
in
man
as
the
true
essence
then
for
me
everything
falls
primarily
into
the
classes
of
man
and
the
un
man
etc
criticism
has
to
this
day
remained
a
work
of
love
for
at
all
times
we
exercised
it
for
the
love
of
some
being
all
servile
criticism
is
a
product
of
love
a
possessedness
and
proceeds
according
to
that
new
testament
precept
test
everything
and
hold
fast
the
good

the
good
is
the
touchstone
the
criterion
the
good
returning
under
a
thousand
names
and
forms
remained
always
the
presupposition
remained
the
dogmatic
fixed
point
for
this
criticism
remained
the
q
fixed
idea
the
critic
in
setting
to
work
impartially
presupposes
the
truth
and
seeks
for
the
truth
in
the
belief
that
it
is
to
be
found
he
wants
to
ascertain
the
true
and
has
in
it
that
very
good
presuppose
means
nothing
else
than
put
a
thought
in
front
or
think
something
before
everything
else
and
think
the
rest
from
the
starting
point
of
this
that
has
been
thought
measure
and
criticize
it
by
this
in
other
words
this
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
thinking
is
to
begin
with
something
already
thought
if
thinking
began
at
all
instead
of
being
begun
if
thinking
were
a
subject
an
acting
personality
of
its
own
as
even
the
plant
is
such
then
indeed
there
would
be
no
abandoning
the
principle
that
thinking
must
begin
with
itself
but
it
is
just
the
personification
of
thinking
that
brings
to
pass
those
innumerable
errors
in
the
hegelian
system
they
always
talk
as
if
thinking
or
the
thinking
spirit
that
is
personified
thinking
thinking
as
a
ghost
thought
and
acted
in
critical
liberalism
it
is
always
said
that
criticism
does
this
and
that
or
else
that
self
consciousness
finds
this
and
that
but
if
thinking
ranks
as
the
personal
actor
thinking
itself
must
be
presupposed
if
criticism
ranks
as
such
a
thought
must
likewise
stand
in
front
thinking
and
criticism
could
be
active
only
starting
from
themselves
would
have
to
be
themselves
the
presupposition
of
their
activity
as
without
being
they
could
not
be
active
but
thinking
as
a
thing
presupposed
is
a
fixed
thought
a
dogma
thinking
and
criticism
therefore
can
start
only
from
a
dogma
from
a
thought
a
fixed
idea
a
presupposition
with
this
we
come
back
again
to
what
was
enunciated
above
that
christianity
consists
in
the
development
of
a
world
of
thoughts
or
that
it
is
the
proper
freedom
of
thought
the
free
thought
the
free
spirit
the
true
criticism
which
i
called
servile
is
therefore
just
as
much
free
criticism
for
it
is
not
my
own
the
case
stands
otherwise
when
what
is
yours
is
not
made
into
something
that
is
of
itself
not
personified
not
made
independent
as
a
spirit
to
itself
your
thinking
has
for
a
presupposition
not
thinking
but
you
but
thus
you
do
presuppose
yourself
after
all
yes
but
not
for
myself
but
for
my
thinking
before
my
thinking
there
is
q
i
from
this
it
follows
that
my
thinking
is
not
preceded
by
a
thought
or
that
my
thinking
is
without
a
presupposition
for
the
presupposition
which
i
am
for
my
thinking
is
not
one
made
by
thinking
not
one
thought
of
but
it
is
posited
thinking
itself
it
is
the
owner
of
the
thought
and
proves
only
that
thinking
is
nothing
more
than
q
property
that
an
independent
thinking
a
thinking
spirit
does
not
exist
at
all
this
reversal
of
the
usual
way
of
regarding
things
might
so
resemble
an
empty
playing
with
abstractions
that
even
those
against
whom
it
is
directed
would
acquiesce
in
the
harmless
aspect
i
give
it
if
practical
consequences
were
not
connected
with
it
to
bring
these
into
a
concise
expression
the
assertion
now
made
is
that
man
is
not
the
measure
of
all
things
but
i
am
this
measure
the
servile
critic
has
before
his
eyes
another
being
an
idea
which
he
means
to
serve
therefore
he
only
slays
the
false
idols
for
his
god
what
is
done
for
the
love
of
this
being
what
else
should
it
be
but
a
q
work
of
love
but
i
when
i
criticize
do
not
even
have
myself
before
my
eyes
but
am
only
doing
myself
a
pleasure
amusing
myself
according
to
my
taste
according
to
my
several
needs
i
chew
the
thing
up
or
only
inhale
its
odour
the
distinction
between
the
two
attitudes
will
come
out
still
more
strikingly
if
one
reflects
that
the
servile
critic
because
love
guides
him
supposes
he
is
serving
the
thing
cause
itself
the
truth
or
truth
in
general
people
are
bound
not
to
give
up
but
to
seek
for
what
else
is
it
but
the
tre
suprme
the
highest
essence
even
true
criticism
would
have
to
despair
if
it
lost
faith
in
the
truth
and
yet
the
truth
is
only
a
q
thought
but
it
is
not
merely
a
thought
but
the
thought
that
is
above
all
thoughts
the
irrefragable
thought
it
is
the
thought
itself
which
gives
the
first
hallowing
to
all
others
it
is
the
consecration
of
thoughts
the
absolute
the
sacred
thought
the
truth
wears
longer
than
all
the
gods
for
it
is
only
in
the
truths
service
and
for
love
of
it
that
people
have
overthrown
the
gods
and
at
last
god
himself
the
truth
outlasts
the
downfall
of
the
world
of
gods
for
it
is
the
immortal
soul
of
this
transitory
world
of
gods
it
is
deity
itself
i
will
answer
pilates
question
what
is
truth
truth
is
the
free
thought
the
free
idea
the
free
spirit
truth
is
what
is
free
from
you
what
is
not
your
own
what
is
not
in
your
power
but
truth
is
also
the
completely
unindependent
impersonal
unreal
and
incorporeal
truth
cannot
step
forwar
d
as
you
do
cannot
move
change
develop
truth
awaits
and
receives
everything
from
you
and
itself
is
only
through
you
for
it
exists
only
q
in
your
head
you
concede
that
the
truth
is
a
thought
but
say
that
not
every
thought
is
a
true
one
or
as
you
are
also
likely
to
express
it
not
every
thought
is
truly
and
really
a
thought
and
by
what
do
you
measure
and
recognize
the
thought
by
your
impotence
to
wit
by
your
being
no
longer
able
to
make
any
successful
assault
on
it
when
it
overpowers
you
inspires
you
and
carries
you
away
then
you
hold
it
to
be
the
true
one
its
dominion
over
you
certifies
to
you
its
truth
and
when
it
possesses
you
and
you
are
possessed
by
it
then
you
feel
well
with
it
for
then
you
have
found
your
q
lord
and
master
when
you
were
seeking
the
truth
what
did
your
heart
then
long
for
for
your
master
you
did
not
aspire
to
your
might
but
to
a
mighty
one
and
wanted
to
exalt
a
mighty
one
exalt
ye
the
lord
our
god
the
truth
my
dear
pilate
is
q
the
lord
and
all
who
seek
the
truth
are
seeking
and
praising
the
lord
where
does
the
lord
exist
where
else
but
in
your
head
he
is
only
spirit
and
wherever
you
believe
you
really
see
him
there
he
is
a
q
ghost
for
the
lord
is
merely
something
that
is
thought
of
and
it
was
only
the
christian
pains
and
agony
to
make
the
invisible
visible
the
spiritual
corporeal
that
generated
the
ghost
and
was
the
frightful
misery
of
the
belief
in
ghosts
as
long
as
you
believe
in
the
truth
you
do
not
believe
in
yourself
and
you
are
a
q
servant
a
q
religious
man
you
alone
are
the
truth
or
rather
you
are
more
than
the
truth
which
is
nothing
at
all
before
you
you
too
do
assuredly
ask
about
the
truth
you
too
do
assuredly
criticize
but
you
do
not
ask
about
a
higher
truth
q
to
wit
one
that
should
be
higher
than
you
q
nor
criticize
according
to
the
criterion
of
such
a
truth
you
address
yourself
to
thoughts
and
notions
as
you
do
to
the
appearances
of
things
only
for
the
purpose
of
making
them
palatable
to
you
enjoyable
to
you
and
your
own
you
want
only
to
subdue
them
and
become
their
owner
you
want
to
orient
yourself
and
feel
at
home
in
them
and
you
find
them
true
or
see
them
in
their
true
light
when
they
can
no
longer
slip
away
from
you
no
longer
have
any
unseized
or
uncomprehended
place
or
when
they
are
right
for
you
when
they
are
your
property
if
afterward
they
become
heavier
again
if
they
wriggle
themselves
out
of
your
power
again
then
that
is
just
their
untruth
q
to
wit
your
impotence
your
impotence
is
their
power
your
humility
their
exaltation
their
truth
therefore
is
you
or
is
the
nothing
which
you
are
for
them
and
in
which
they
dissolve
their
truth
is
their
nothingness
only
as
the
property
of
me
do
the
spirits
the
truths
get
to
rest
and
they
then
for
the
first
time
really
are
when
they
have
been
deprived
of
their
sorry
existence
and
made
a
property
of
mine
when
it
is
no
longer
said
the
truth
develops
itself
rules
asserts
itself
history
also
a
concept
wins
the
victory
and
the
like
the
truth
never
has
won
a
victory
but
was
always
my
means
to
the
victory
like
the
sword
the
sword
of
truth
the
truth
is
dead
a
letter
a
word
a
material
that
i
can
use
up
all
truth
by
itself
is
dead
a
corpse
it
is
alive
only
in
the
same
way
as
my
lungs
are
alive
q
to
wit
in
the
measure
of
my
own
vitality
truths
are
material
like
vegetables
and
weeds
as
to
whether
vegetable
or
weed
the
decision
lies
in
me
objects
are
to
me
only
material
that
i
use
up
wherever
i
put
my
hand
i
grasp
a
truth
which
i
trim
for
myself
the
truth
is
certain
to
me
and
i
do
not
need
to
long
after
it
to
do
the
truth
a
service
is
in
no
case
my
intent
it
is
to
me
only
a
nourishment
for
my
thinking
head
as
potatoes
are
for
my
digesting
stomach
or
as
a
friend
is
for
my
social
heart
as
long
as
i
have
the
humour
and
force
for
thinking
every
truth
serves
me
only
for
me
to
work
it
up
according
to
my
powers
as
reality
or
worldliness
is
vain
and
a
thing
of
naught
for
christians
so
is
the
truth
for
me
it
exists
exactly
as
much
as
the
things
of
this
world
go
on
existing
although
the
christian
has
proved
their
nothingness
but
it
is
vain
because
it
has
its
value
not
in
itself
but
in
me
of
itself
it
is
valueless
the
truth
is
a
q
creature
as
you
produce
innumerable
things
by
your
activity
yes
shape
the
earths
surface
anew
and
set
up
works
of
men
everywhere
so
too
you
may
still
ascertain
numberless
truths
by
your
thinking
and
we
will
gladly
take
delight
in
them
nevertheless
as
i
do
not
please
to
hand
myself
over
to
serve
your
newly
discovered
machines
mechanically
but
only
help
to
set
them
running
for
my
benefit
so
too
i
will
only
use
your
truths
without
letting
myself
be
used
for
their
demands
all
truths
beneath
me
are
to
my
liking
a
truth
above
me
a
truth
that
i
should
have
to
direct
myself
by
i
am
not
acquainted
with
for
me
there
is
no
truth
for
nothing
is
more
than
i
not
even
my
essence
not
even
the
essence
of
man
is
more
than
i
than
i
this
drop
in
the
bucket
this
insignificant
man
you
believe
that
you
have
done
the
utmost
when
you
boldly
assert
that
because
every
time
has
its
own
truth
there
is
no
absolute
truth
why
with
this
you
nevertheless
still
leave
to
each
time
its
truth
and
thus
you
quite
genuinely
create
an
absolute
truth
a
truth
that
no
time
lacks
because
every
time
however
its
truth
may
be
still
has
a
truth
is
it
meant
only
that
people
have
been
thinking
in
every
time
and
so
have
had
thoughts
or
truths
and
that
in
the
subsequent
time
these
were
other
than
they
were
in
the
earlier
no
the
word
is
to
be
that
every
time
had
its
truth
of
faith
and
in
fact
none
has
yet
appeared
in
which
a
higher
truth
has
not
been
recognized
a
truth
that
people
believed
they
must
subject
themselves
to
as
highness
and
majesty
every
truth
of
a
time
is
its
fixed
idea
and
if
people
later
found
another
truth
this
always
happened
only
because
they
sought
for
another
they
only
reformed
the
folly
and
put
a
modern
dress
on
it
for
they
did
want
q
who
would
dare
doubt
their
justification
for
this
q
they
wanted
to
be
inspired
by
an
idea
they
wanted
to
be
dominated
q
possessed
by
a
thought
the
most
modern
ruler
of
this
kind
is
our
essence
or
man
for
all
free
criticism
a
thought
was
the
criterion
for
own
criticism
i
am
i
the
unspeakable
and
so
not
the
merely
thought
of
for
what
is
merely
thought
of
is
always
speakable
because
word
and
thought
coincide
that
is
true
which
is
mine
untrue
that
whose
own
i
am
true
as
in
the
union
untrue
the
state
and
society
free
and
true
criticism
takes
care
for
the
consistent
dominion
of
a
thought
an
idea
a
spirit
own
criticism
for
nothing
but
my
self
enjoyment
but
in
this
the
latter
is
in
fact
q
and
we
will
not
spare
it
this
ignominy
q
like
the
bestial
criticism
of
instinct
i
like
the
criticizing
beast
am
concerned
only
for
myself
not
for
the
cause
i
am
the
criterion
of
truth
but
i
am
not
an
idea
but
more
than
idea
that
is
unutterable
my
criticism
is
not
a
free
criticism
not
free
from
me
and
not
servile
not
in
the
service
of
an
idea
but
an
own
criticism
true
or
human
criticism
makes
out
only
whether
something
is
suitable
to
man
to
the
true
man
but
by
own
criticism
you
ascertain
whether
it
is
suitable
to
you
free
criticism
busies
itself
with
ideas
and
therefore
is
always
theoretical
however
it
may
rage
against
ideas
it
still
does
not
get
clear
of
them
it
pitches
into
the
ghosts
but
it
can
do
this
only
as
it
holds
them
to
be
ghosts
the
ideas
it
has
to
do
with
do
not
fully
disappear
the
morning
breeze
of
a
new
day
does
not
scare
them
away
the
critic
may
indeed
come
to
ataraxia
before
ideas
but
he
never
gets
rid
of
them
he
will
never
comprehend
that
above
the
bodily
man
there
does
not
exist
something
higher
q
to
wit
liberty
his
humanity
etc
he
always
has
a
calling
of
man
still
left
humanity
and
this
idea
of
humanity
remains
unrealized
just
because
it
is
an
idea
and
is
to
remain
such
if
on
the
other
hand
i
grasp
the
idea
as
my
idea
then
it
is
already
realized
because
i
am
its
reality
its
reality
consists
in
the
fact
that
i
the
bodily
have
it
they
say
the
idea
of
liberty
realizes
itself
in
the
history
of
the
world
the
reverse
is
the
case
this
idea
is
real
as
a
man
thinks
it
and
it
is
real
in
the
measure
in
which
it
is
idea
that
is
in
which
i
think
it
or
have
it
it
is
not
the
idea
of
liberty
that
develops
itself
but
men
develop
themselves
and
of
course
in
this
self
development
develop
their
thinking
too
in
short
the
critic
is
not
yet
owner
because
he
still
fights
with
ideas
as
with
powerful
aliens
q
as
the
christian
is
not
owner
of
his
bad
desires
so
long
as
he
has
to
combat
them
for
him
who
contends
against
vice
vice
exists
criticism
remains
stuck
fast
in
the
freedom
of
knowing
the
freedom
of
the
spirit
and
the
spirit
gains
its
proper
freedom
when
it
fills
itself
with
the
pure
true
idea
this
is
the
freedom
of
thinking
which
cannot
be
without
thoughts
criticism
smites
one
idea
only
by
another
such
as
that
of
privilege
by
that
of
manhood
or
that
of
egoism
by
that
of
unselfishness
in
general
the
beginning
of
christianity
comes
on
the
stage
again
in
its
critical
end
egoism
being
combated
here
as
there
i
am
not
to
make
myself
the
individual
count
but
the
idea
the
general
why
warfare
of
the
priesthood
with
egoism
of
the
spirituallyminded
with
the
worldly
minded
constitutes
the
substance
of
all
christian
history
in
the
newest
criticism
this
war
only
becomes
all
embracing
fanaticism
complete
indeed
neither
can
it
pass
away
till
it
passes
thus
after
it
has
had
its
life
and
its
rage
out

whether
what
i
think
and
do
is
christian
what
do
i
care
whether
it
is
human
liberal
humane
whether
unhuman
illiberal
inhuman
what
do
i
ask
about
that
if
only
it
accomplishes
what
i
want
if
only
i
satisfy
myself
in
it
then
overlay
it
with
predicates
as
you
will
it
is
all
alike
to
me
perhaps
i
too
in
the
very
next
moment
defend
myself
against
my
former
thoughts
i
too
am
likely
to
change
suddenly
my
mode
of
action
but
not
on
account
of
its
not
corresponding
to
christianity
not
on
account
of
its
running
counter
to
the
eternal
rights
of
man
not
on
account
of
its
affronting
the
idea
of
mankind
humanity
and
humanitarianism
but
q
because
i
am
no
longer
all
in
it
because
it
no
longer
furnishes
me
any
full
enjoyment
because
i
doubt
the
earlier
thought
or
no
longer
please
myself
in
the
mode
of
action
just
now
practiced
as
the
world
as
property
has
become
a
material
with
which
i
undertake
what
i
will
so
the
spirit
too
as
property
must
sink
down
into
a
material
before
which
i
no
longer
entertain
any
sacred
dread
then
firstly
i
shall
shudder
no
more
before
a
thought
let
it
appear
as
presumptuous
and
devilish
as
it
will
because
if
it
threatens
to
become
too
inconvenient
and
unsatisfactory
for
me
its
end
lies
in
my
power
but
neither
shall
i
recoil
from
any
deed
because
there
dwells
in
it
a
spirit
of
godlessness
immorality
wrongfulness
as
little
as
st
boniface
pleased
to
desist
through
religious
scrupulousness
from
cutting
down
the
sacred
oak
of
the
heathens
if
the
things
of
the
world
have
once
become
vain
the
thoughts
of
the
spirit
must
also
become
vain
no
thought
is
sacred
for
let
no
thought
rank
as
devotions

no
feeling
is
sacred
no
sacred
feeling
of
friendship
mothers
feelings
etc
no
belief
is
sacred
they
are
all
alienable
my
alienable
property
and
are
annihilated
as
they
are
created
by
me
the
christian
can
lose
all
things
or
objects
the
most
loved
persons
these
objects
of
his
love
without
giving
up
himself
that
is
in
the
christian
sense
his
spirit
his
soul
as
lost
the
owner
can
cast
from
him
all
the
thoughts
that
were
dear
to
his
heart
and
kindled
his
zeal
and
will
likewise
gain
a
thousandfold
again
because
he
their
creator
remains
unconsciously
and
involuntarily
we
all
strive
toward
ownness
and
there
will
hardly
be
one
among
us
who
has
not
given
up
a
sacred
feeling
a
sacred
thought
a
sacred
belief
nay
we
probably
meet
no
one
who
could
not
still
deliver
himself
from
one
or
another
of
his
sacred
thoughts
all
our
contention
against
convictions
starts
from
the
opinion
that
maybe
we
are
capable
of
driving
our
opponent
out
of
his
entrenchments
of
thought
but
what
i
do
unconsciously
i
half
do
and
therefore
after
every
victory
over
a
faith
i
become
again
the
prisoner
possessed
of
a
faith
which
then
takes
my
whole
self
anew
into
its
service
and
makes
me
an
enthusiast
for
reason
after
i
have
ceased
to
be
enthusiastic
for
the
bible
or
an
enthusiast
for
the
idea
of
humanity
after
i
have
fought
long
enough
for
that
of
christianity
doubtless
as
owner
of
thoughts
i
shall
cover
my
property
with
my
shield
just
as
i
do
not
as
owner
of
things
willingly
let
everybody
help
himself
to
them
but
at
the
same
time
i
shall
look
forward
smilingly
to
the
outcome
of
the
battle
smilingly
lay
the
shield
on
the
corpses
of
my
thoughts
and
my
faith
smilingly
triumph
when
i
am
beaten
that
is
the
very
humour
of
the
thing
every
one
who
has
sublimer
feelings
is
able
to
vent
his
humour
on
the
pettinesses
of
men
but
to
let
it
play
with
all
great
thoughts
sublime
feelings
noble
inspiration
and
sacred
faith
presupposes
that
i
am
the
owner
of
all
if
religion
has
set
up
the
proposition
that
we
are
sinners
altogether
i
set
over
against
it
the
other
we
are
perfect
altogether
for
we
are
every
moment
all
that
we
can
be
and
we
never
need
be
more
since
no
defect
cleaves
to
us
sin
has
no
meaning
either
show
me
a
sinner
in
the
world
still
if
no
one
any
longer
needs
to
do
what
suits
a
superior
if
i
only
need
do
what
suits
myself
i
am
no
sinner
if
i
do
not
do
what
suits
myself
as
i
do
not
injure
in
myself
a
holy
one
if
on
the
other
hand
i
am
to
be
pious
then
i
must
do
what
suits
god
if
i
am
to
act
humanly
i
must
do
what
suits
the
essence
of
man
the
idea
of
mankind
etc
what
religion
calls
the
sinner
humanitarianism
calls
the
egoist
but
once
more
if
i
need
not
do
what
suits
any
other
is
the
egoist
in
whom
humanitarianism
has
borne
to
itself
a
new
fangled
devil
anything
more
than
a
piece
of
nonsense
the
egoist
before
whom
the
humane
shudder
is
a
spook
as
much
as
the
devil
is
he
exists
only
as
a
bogie
and
phantasm
in
their
brain
if
they
were
not
unsophisticatedly
drifting
back
and
forth
in
the
antediluvian
opposition
of
good
and
evil
to
which
they
have
given
the
modern
names
of
human
and
egoistic
they
would
not
have
freshened
up
the
hoary
sinner
into
an
egoist
either
and
put
a
new
patch
on
an
old
garment
but
they
could
not
do
otherwise
for
they
hold
it
for
their
task
to
be
men
they
are
rid
of
the
good
one
good
is
left

we
are
perfect
altogether
and
on
the
whole
earth
there
is
not
one
man
who
is
a
sinner
there
are
crazy
people
who
imagine
that
they
are
god
the
father
god
the
son
or
the
man
in
the
moon
and
so
too
the
world
swarms
with
fools
who
seem
to
themselves
to
be
sinners
but
as
the
former
are
not
the
man
in
the
moon
so
the
latter
are
q
not
sinners
their
sin
is
imaginary
yet
it
is
insidiously
objected
their
craziness
or
their
possessedness
is
at
least
their
sin
their
possessedness
is
nothing
but
what
they
q
could
achieve
the
result
of
their
development
just
as
luthers
faith
in
the
bible
was
all
that
he
was
q
competent
to
make
out
the
one
brings
himself
into
the
madhouse
with
his
development
the
other
brings
himself
therewith
into
the
pantheon
and
to
the
loss
of
q
valhalla
there
is
no
sinner
and
no
sinful
egoism
get
away
from
me
with
your
philanthropy
creep
in
you
philantropist
into
the
dens
of
vice
linger
awhile
in
the
throng
of
the
great
city
will
you
not
everywhere
find
sin
and
sin
and
again
sin
will
you
not
wail
over
corrupt
humanity
not
lament
at
the
monstrous
egoism
will
you
see
a
rich
man
without
finding
him
pitiless
and
egoistic
perhaps
you
already
call
yourself
an
atheist
but
you
remain
true
to
the
christian
feeling
that
a
camel
will
sooner
go
through
a
needles
eye
than
a
rich
man
not
be
an
un
man
how
many
do
you
see
anyhow
that
you
would
not
throw
into
the
egoistic
mass
what
therefore
has
your
philanthropy
love
of
man
found
nothing
but
unlovable
men
and
where
do
they
all
come
from
from
you
from
your
philanthropy
you
brought
the
sinner
with
you
in
your
head
therefore
you
found
him
therefore
you
inserted
him
everywhere
do
not
call
men
sinners
and
they
are
not
you
alone
are
the
creator
of
sinners
you
who
fancy
that
you
love
men
are
the
very
one
to
throw
them
into
the
mire
of
sin
the
very
one
to
divide
them
into
vicious
and
virtuous
into
men
and
un
men
the
very
one
to
befoul
them
with
the
slaver
of
your
possessedness
for
you
love
not
men
but
man
but
i
tell
you
you
have
never
seen
a
sinner
you
have
only
q
dreamed
of
him
self
enjoyment
is
embittered
to
me
by
my
thinking
i
must
serve
another
by
my
fancying
myself
under
obligation
to
him
by
my
holding
myself
called
to
self
sacrifice
resignation
enthusiasm
all
right
if
i
no
longer
serve
any
idea
any
higher
essence
then
it
is
clear
of
itself
that
i
no
longer
serve
any
man
either
but
q
under
all
circumstances
q
myself
but
thus
i
am
not
merely
in
fact
or
in
being
but
also
for
my
consciousness
the
q
unique

there
pertains
to
you
more
than
the
divine
the
human
etc
yours
pertains
to
you
look
upon
yourself
as
more
powerful
than
they
give
you
out
for
and
you
have
more
power
look
upon
yourself
as
more
and
you
have
more
you
are
then
not
merely
called
to
everything
divine
entitled
to
everything
human
but
owner
of
what
is
yours
that
is
of
all
that
you
possess
the
force
to
make
your
own

you
are
appropriate
and
capacitated
for
everything
that
is
yours
people
have
always
supposed
that
they
must
give
me
a
destiny
lying
outside
myself
so
that
at
last
they
demanded
that
i
should
lay
claim
to
the
human
because
i
am
q
man
this
is
the
christian
magic
circle
fichtes
ego
too
is
the
same
essence
outside
me
for
every
one
is
ego
and
if
only
this
ego
has
rights
then
it
is
the
ego
it
is
not
i
but
i
am
not
an
ego
along
with
other
egos
but
the
sole
ego
i
am
unique
hence
my
wants
too
are
unique
and
my
deeds
in
short
everything
about
me
is
unique
and
it
is
only
as
this
unique
i
that
i
take
everything
for
my
own
as
i
set
myself
to
work
and
develop
myself
only
as
this
i
do
not
develop
men
nor
as
man
but
as
i
i
develop
myself
this
is
the
meaning
of
the
unique
one

only
when
it
dies

and
it
is
the

now
we
have
before

neither

when
this

seemed
to
be
satisfied
and
this

to
have
come
the
others
immediately
for
the
secularisation
of
this
spirit
again
which
must
forever
remain
a
pious
wish
the
pious
wish
of
the
ancients
was
sanctity
the
pious
wish
of
the
moderns
is
corporeity
but
as
antiquity
had
to
go
down
if
its
longing
was
to
be
satisfied
for
it
consisted
only
in
the
longing
so
too
corporeity
can
never
be
attained
within
the
ring
of
christianness
as
the
trait
of
sanctification
or
purification
goes
through
the
old
world
the
washings

so
that
of
incorporation
goes

god
plunges
down
into
this
world
becomes
flesh

wants
to
redeem
it
that
is
fill
it
with
himself
but
since
he
is
the

or
the
spirit
people
hegel
for
example
in
the
end
introduce
the
idea
into
everything
into
the
world
and
prove
that
the
idea
is
that
reason
is
in
everything
man
corresponds
in
the
culture
of
today
to
what
the
heathen
stoics
set
up

like
the

q
fleshless

bodiless

the
bodiless

in

there
winds
its
way
through
christianity
the
question
about
the
existence
of
god
which
taken
up
ever
and
ever
again
gives
testimony
that
the
craving
for
existence
corporeity
personality
reality
was
incessantly
busying
the
heart
because
it
never
found
a
satisfying
solution
at
last
the
question
about
the
existence
of
god
fell
but
only
to
rise
up
again
in
the
proposition
that
the
divine
had
existence
feuerbach
but
this
too
has
no
existence
and
neither
will
the
last
refuge
that
the
purely
human
is
realizable
afford
shelter
much
longer
no
idea
has
existence
for
none
is
capable
of
corporeity
the
scholastic
contention
of
realism
and
nominalism
has
the
same
content
in
short
this
spins
itself
out
through
all
christian
history
and
cannot
end
in
it
the
world
of
christians
is
working
at
realizing
ideas
in
the
individual
relations
of
life
the
institutions
and
laws
of
the
church
and
the
state
but
they
make
resistance
and
always
keep
back
something
unembodied
unrealizable
nevertheless
this
embodiment
is
restlessly
rushed
after
no
matter
in
what
degree
corporeity
constantly
fails
to
result
for
realities
matter
little
to
the
realizer
but
it
matters
everything
that
they
be
realizations
of
the
idea
hence
he
is
ever
examining
anew
whether
the
realized
does
in
truth
have
the
idea
its
kernel
dwelling
in
it
and
in
testing
the
real
he
at
the
same
time
tests
the
idea
whether
it
is
realizable
as
he
thinks
it
or
is
only
thought
by
him
incorrectly
and
for
that
reason
unfeasibly
the
christian
is
no
longer
to
care
for
family
state
etc
as
existences
christians
are
not
to
sacrifice
themselves
for
these
divine
things
like
the
ancients
but
these
are
only
to
be
utilized
to
make
the
spirit
alive
in
them
the
real
family
has
become
indifferent
and
there
is
to
arise
out
of
it
an
ideal
one
which
would
then
be
the
truly
real
a
sacred
family
blessed
by
god
or
according
to
the
liberal
way
of
thinking
a
rational
family
with
the
ancients
family
state
fatherland
is
divine
as
a
thing
extant
with
the
moderns
it
is
still
awaiting
divinity
as
extant
it
is
only
sinful
earthly
and
has
still
to
be
redeemed
that
is
to
become
truly
real
this
has
the
following
meaning
the
family
etc
is
not
the
extant
and
real
but
the
divine
the
idea
is
extant
and
real
whether
this
family
will
make
itself
real
by
taking
up
the
truly
real
the
idea
is
still
unsetted
it
is
not
the
individuals
task
to
serve
the
family
as
the
divine
but
reversely
to
serve
the
divine
and
to
bring
to
it
the
still
undivine
family
to
subject
everything
in
the
ideas
name
to
set
up
the
ideas
banner
everywhere
to
bring
the
idea
to
real
efficacy
but
since
the
concern
of
christianity
as
of
antiquity
is
for
the
divine
they
always
come
out
at
this
again
on
their
opposite
ways
at
the
end
of
heathenism
the
divine
becomes
the
extramundane
at
the
end
of
christianity
the
intramundane
antiquity
does
not
succeed
in
putting
it
entirely
outside
the
world
and
when
christianity
accomplishes
this
task
the
divine
instantly
longs
to
get
back
into
the
world
and
wants
to
redeem
the
world
but
within
christianity
it
does
not
and
cannot
come
to
this
that
the
divine
as
intramundane
should
really
become
the
mundane
itself
there
is
enough
left
that
does
and
must
maintain
itself
unpenetrated
as
the
bad
irrational
accidental
egoistic
the
mundane
in
the
bad
sense
christianity
begins
with
gods
becoming
man
and
carries
on
its
work
of
conversion
and
redemption
through
all
time
in
order
to
prepare
for
god
a
reception
in
all
men
and
in
everything
human
and
to
penetrate
everything
with
the
spirit
it
sticks
to
preparing
a
place
for
the
spirit
when
the
accent
was
at
last
laid
on
man
or
mankind
it
was
again
the
idea
that

pronounced

it

this

be

if
the
strained
relation
between
existence
and
calling
that
is
between
me
as
i
am
and
me
as
i
should
be
ceased
it
persists
only
as
the
longing
of
the
idea
for
its
bodiliness
and
vanishes
with
the
relaxing
separation
of
the
two
only
when
the

remains
q

a

the

the
corporeal

floats
before

it

to

the

only
have

in

according

the
modern
notion
of
the

in

of
humanity
and
only
so
far
as
he
has
a
part
in
it
does
a
christian
or
according
to
the
modern
expression
human
value
pertain
to
him
for
the
rest
he
is
dust
and
a
worm
bag
that
the
individual
is
of
himself
a
worlds
history
and
possesses
his

in
the
rest
of
the

history
goes
beyond
what
is
christian
to
the
christian
the
worlds
history
is
the
higher
thing
because
it
is
the
history
of
christ
or
man
to
the
egoist
only
his
history
has
value
because
he
wants
to
develop
only
himself
not
the
mankind
idea
not
gods
plan
not
the
purposes
of
providence
not
liberty
and
the
like
he
does
not
look
upon
himself
as
a
tool
of
the
idea
or
a
vessel
of
god
he
recognizes
no
calling
he
does
not
fancy
that
he
exists
for
the
further
development
of
mankind
and
that
he
must
contribute
his
mite
to
it
but
he
lives
himself
out
careless
of
how
well
or
ill
humanity
may
fare
thereby
if
it
were
not
open
to
confusion
with
the
idea
that
a

of

be
praised

what
am

in

to
do
my

bring

what

after

as

as
the

grows
and
gives

after

the

is

when
the
christian
apprehension
turns
about
and
becomes
the
proposition
i
this
unique
one
am

the
conceptual
question
what
is
man
q
has
then
changed
into
the
personal

who

with
what
the
concept
was
sought
for
in

to
realize
it
with
who
it
is
no
longer
any
question
at
all
but
the
answer
is
personally
on
hand
at
once
in
the
asker
the
question
answers
itself
they
say
of
god
names
name
thee
not
that
holds
good
of
me
no
concept
expresses
me
nothing
that
is
designated
as
my
essence
exhausts
me
they
are
only
names
likewise
they
say
of
god
that
he
is
perfect
and
has
no
calling
to
strive
after
perfection
that
too
holds
good
of
me
alone
i
am
owner
of
my
might
and
i
am
so
when
i
know
myself
as
unique
in
the
unique
one
the
owner
himself
returns
into
his
creative
nothing
of
which
he
is
born
every
higher
essence
above
me
be
it
god
be
it
man
weakens
the
feeling
of
my
uniqueness
and
pales
only
before
the
sun
of
this
consciousness
if
i
concern
myself
for
myself

the
unique
one
then
my
concern
rests
on
its
transitory
mortal
creator
who
consumes
himself
and
i
may
say
all
things
are
nothing
to
me

translators
preface
to
the
english
editions
if
the
style
of
this
book
is
found
unattractive
it
will
show
that
i
have
done
my
work
ill
and
not
represented
the
author
truly
but
if
it
is
found
odd
i
beg
that
i
may
not
bear
all
the
blame
i
have
simply
tried
to
reproduce
the
authors
own
mixture
of
colloquialisms
and
technicalities
and
his
preference
for
the
precise
expression
of
his
thought
rather
than
the
word
conventionally
expected
one
especial
feature
of
the
style
however
gives
the
reason
why
this
preface
should
exist
it
is
characteristic
of
stirners
writing
that
the
thread
of
thought
is
carried
on
largely
by
the
repetition
of
the
same
word
in
a
modified
form
or
sense
that
connection
of
ideas
which
has
guided
popular
instinct
in
the
formation
of
words
is
made
to
suggest
the
line
of
thought
which
the
writer
wishes
to
follow
if
this
echoing
of
words
is
missed
the
bearing
of
the
statements
on
each
other
is
in
a
measure
lost
and
where
the
ideas
are
very
new
one
cannot
afford
to
throw
away
any
help
in
following
their
connection
therefore
where
a
useful
echo
and
then
are
few
useless
ones
in
the
book
could
not
be
reproduced
in
english
i
have
generally
called
attention
to
it
in
a
note
my
notes
are
distinguished
from
the
authors
by
being
enclosed
in
parentheses
one
or
two
of
such
coincidences
of
language
occurring
in
words
which
are
prominent
throughout
the
book
should
be
borne
constantly
in
mind
as
a
sort
of
keri
perpetuum
for
instance
the
identity
in
the
original
of
the
words
spirit
and
mind
and
of
the
phrases
supreme
being
and
highest
essence
in
such
cases
i
have
repeated
the
note
where
it
seemed
that
such
repetition
might
be
absolutely
necessary
but
have
trusted
the
reader
to
carry
it
in
his
head
where
a
failure
of
his
memory
would
not
be
ruinous
or
likely
for
the
same
reasonqthat
is
in
order
not
to
miss
any
indication
of
the
drift
of
the
thought
q
i
have
followed
the
original
in
the
very
liberal
use
of
italics
and
in
the
occasional
eccentric
use
of
a
punctuation
mark
as
i
might
not
have
done
in
translating
a
work
of
a
different
nature
i
have
set
my
face
as
a
flint
against
the
temptation
to
add
notes
that
were
not
part
of
the
translation
there
is
no
telling
how
much
i
might
have
enlarged
the
book
if
i
had
put
a
note
at
every
sentence
which
deserved
to
have
its
truth
brought
out
by
fuller
elucidation
q
or
even
at
every
one
which
i
thought
needed
correction
it
might
have
been
within
my
province
if
i
had
been
able
to
explain
all
the
allusions
to
contemporary
events
but
i
doubt
whether
any
one
could
do
that
properly
without
having
access
to
the
files
of
three
or
four
well
chosen
german
newspapers
of
stirners
time
the
allusions
are
clear
enough
without
names
and
dates
to
give
a
vivid
picture
of
certain
aspects
of
german
life
then
the
tone
of
some
of
them
is
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
book
was
published
under
censorship
i
have
usually
preferred
for
the
sake
of
the
connection
to
translate
biblical
quotations
somewhat
as
they
stand
in
the
german
rather
than
conform
them
altogether
to
the
english
bible
i
am
sometimes
quite
as
near
the
original
greek
as
if
i
had
followed
the
current
translation
where
german
books
are
referred
to
the
pages
cited
are
those
of
the
german
editions
even
when
usually
because
of
some
allusions
in
the
text
the
titles
of
the
books
are
translated
steven
t
byington
publisher
s
preface
to
the
first
american
edition
for
more
than
twenty
years
i
have
entertained
the
design
of
publishing
an
english
translation
of
der
einzige
und
sein
eigentum
when
i
formed
this
design
the
number
of
english
speaking
persons
who
had
ever
heard
of
the
book
was
very
limited
the
memory
of
max
stirner
had
been
virtually
extinct
for
an
entire
generation
but
in
the
last
two
decades
there
has
been
a
remarkable
revival
of
interest
both
in
the
book
and
in
its
author
it
began
in
this
country
with
a
discussion
in
the
pages
of
the
anarchist
periodical
liberty
in
which
stirners
thought
was
clearly
expounded
and
vigorously
championed
by
dr
james
l
walker
who
adopted
for
this
discussion
the
pseudonym
tak
kak
at
that
time
dr
walker
was
the
chief
editorial
writer
for
the
galveston
news
some
years
later
he
became
a
practising
physician
in
mexico
where
he
died
in

a
series
of
essays
which
he
began
in
an
anarchist
periodical
egoism
and
which
he
lived
to
complete
was
published
after
his
death
in
a
small
volume
the
philosophy
of
egoism
it
is
a
very
able
and
convincing
exposition
of
stirners
teachings
and
almost
the
only
one
that
exists
in
the
english
language
but
the
chief
instrument
in
the
revival
of
stirnerism
was
and
is
the
german
poet
john
henry
mackay
very
early
in
his
career
he
met
stirners
name
in
langes
history
of
materialism
and
was
moved
thereby
to
read
his
book
the
work
made
such
an
impression
on
him
that
he
resolved
to
devote
a
portion
of
his
life
to
the
rediscovery
and
rehabilitation
of
the
lost
and
forgotten
genius
through
years
of
toil
and
correspondence
and
travel
and
triumphing
over
tremendous
obstacles
he
carried
his
task
to
completion
and
his
biography
of
stirner
appeared
in
berlin
in

it
is
a
tribute
to
the
thoroughness
of
mackays
work
that
since
its
publication
not
one
important
fact
about
stirner
has
been
discovered
by
anybody
during
his
years
of
investigation
mackays
advertising
for
information
had
created
a
new
interest
in
stirner
which
was
enhanced
by
the
sudden
fame
of
the
writings
of
friedrich
nietzsche
an
author
whose
intellectual
kinship
with
stirner
has
been
a
subject
of
much
controversy
der
einzige
previously
obtainable
only
in
an
expensive
form
was
included
in
philipp
reclams
universal
bibliothek
and
this
cheap
edition
has
enjoyed
a
wide
and
ever
increasing
circulation
during
the
last
dozen
years
the
book
has
been
translated
twice
into
french
once
into
italian
once
into
russian
and
possibly
into
other
languages
the
scandinavian
critic
brandes
has
written
on
stirner
a
large
and
appreciative
volume
entitled
lindividualisme
anarchiste
max
stirner
from
the
pen
of
prof
victor
basch
of
the
university
of
rennes
has
appeared
in
paris
another
large
and
sympathetic
volume
max
stirner
written
by
dr
anselm
ruest
has
been
published
very
recently
in
berlin
dr
paul
eltzbacher
in
his
work
der
anarchismus
gives
a
chapter
to
stirner
making
him
one
of
the
seven
typical
anarchists
beginning
with
william
godwin
and
ending
with
tolstoi
of
whom
his
book
treats
there
is
hardly
a
notable
magazine
or
a
review
on
the
continent
that
has
not
given
at
least
one
leading
article
to
the
subject
of
stirner
upon
the
initiative
of
mackay
and
with
the
aid
of
other
admirers
a
suitable
stone
has
been
placed
above
the
philosophers
previously
neglected
grave
and
a
memorial
tablet
upon
the
house
in
berlin
where
he
died
in

and
this
spring
another
is
to
be
placed
upon
the
house
in
bayreuth
where
he
was
born
in

as
a
result
of
these
various
efforts
and
though
but
little
has
been
written
about
stirner
in
the
english
language
his
name
is
now
known
at
least
to
thousands
in
america
and
england
where
formerly
it
was
known
only
to
hundreds
therefore
conditions
are
now
more
favourable
for
the
reception
of
this
volume
than
they
were
when
i
formed
the
design
of
publishing
it
more
than
twenty
years
ago
the
problem
of
securing
a
reasonably
good
translation
for
in
the
case
of
a
work
presenting
difficulties
so
enormous
it
was
idle
to
hope
for
an
adequate
translation
was
finally
solved
by
entrusting
the
task
to
steven
t
byington
a
scholar
of
remarkable
attainments
whose
specialty
is
philology
and
who
is
also
one
of
the
ablest
workers
in
the
propaganda
of
anarchism
but
for
further
security
from
error
it
was
agreed
with
mr
byington
that
his
translation
should
have
the
benefit
of
revision
by
dr
walker
the
most
thorough
american
student
of
stirner
and
by
emma
heller
schumm
and
george
schumm
who
are
not
only
sympathetic
with
stirner
but
familiar
with
the
history
of
his
time
and
who
enjoy
a
knowledge
of
english
and
german
that
makes
it
difficult
to
decide
which
is
their
native
tongue
it
was
also
agreed
that
upon
any
point
of
difference
between
the
translator
and
his
revisers
which
consultation
might
fail
to
solve
the
publisher
should
decide
this
method
has
been
followed
and
in
a
considerable
number
of
instances
it
has
fallen
to
me
to
make
a
decision
it
is
only
fair
to
say
therefore
that
the
responsibility
for
special
errors
and
imperfections
properly
rests
on
my
shoulders
whereas
on
the
other
hand
the
credit
for
whatever
general
excellence
the
translation
may
possess
belongs
with
the
same
propriety
to
mr
byington
and
his
coadjutors
one
thing
is
certain
its
defects
are
due
to
no
lack
of
loving
care
and
pains
and
i
think
i
may
add
with
confidence
while
realizing
fully
how
far
short
of
perfection
it
necessarily
falls
that
it
may
safely
challenge
comparison
with
the
translations
that
have
been
made
into
other
languages
in
particular
i
am
responsible
for
the
admittedly
erroneous
rendering
of
the
title
the
ego
and
his
own
is
not
an
exact
english
equivalent
of
der
einzige
und
sein
eigentum
but
then
there
is
no
exact
english
equivalent
perhaps
the
nearest
is
the
unique
one
and
his
property
but
the
unique
one
is
not
strictly
the
einzige
for
uniqueness
connotes
not
only
singleness
but
an
admirable
singleness
while
stirners
einzigkeit
is
admirable
in
his
eyes
only
as
such
it
being
no
part
of
the
purpose
of
his
book
to
distinguish
a
particular
einzigkeit
as
more
excellent
than
another
moreover
the
unique
one
and
his
property
has
no
graces
to
compel
our
forgiveness
of
its
slight
inaccuracy
it
is
clumsy
and
unattractive
and
the
same
objections
may
be
urged
with
still
greater
force
against
all
the
other
renderings
that
have
been
suggested
q
the
single
one
and
his
property
the
only
one
and
his
property
the
lone
one
and
his
property
the
unit
and
his
property
and
last
and
least
and
worst
the
individual
and
his
prerogative
the
ego
and
his
own
on
the
other
hand
if
not
a
precise
rendering
is
at
least
an
excellent
title
in
itself
excellent
by
its
euphony
its
monosyllabic
incisiveness
and
its
telling
q
einzigkeit
another
strong
argument
in
its
favour
is
the
emphatic
correspondence
of
the
phrase
his
own
with
mr
byingtons
renderings
of
the
kindred
words
eigenheit
and
eigner
moreover
no
reader
will
be
led
astray
who
bears
in
mind
stirners
distinction
i
am
not
an
ego
along
with
other
egos
but
the
sole
ego
i
am
unique
and
to
help
the
reader
to
bear
this
in
mind
the
various
renderings
of
the
word
einzige
that
occur
through
the
volume
are
often
accompanied
by
foot
notes
showing
that
in
the
german
one
and
the
same
word
does
duty
for
all
if
the
reader
finds
the
first
quarter
of
this
book
somewhat
forbidding
and
obscure
he
is
advised
nevertheless
not
to
falter
close
attention
will
master
almost
every
difficulty
and
if
he
will
but
give
it
he
will
find
abundant
reward
in
what
follows
for
his
guidance
i
may
specify
one
defect
in
the
authors
style
when
controverting
a
view
opposite
to
his
own
he
seldom
distinguishes
with
sufficient
clearness
his
statement
of
his
own
view
from
his
re
statement
of
the
antagonistic
view
as
a
result
the
reader
is
plunged
into
deeper
and
deeper
mystification
until
something
suddenly
reveals
the
cause
of
his
misunderstanding
after
which
he
must
go
back
and
read
again
i
therefore
put
him
on
his
guard
the
other
difficulties
lie
as
a
rule
in
the
structure
of
the
work
as
to
these
i
can
hardly
do
better
than
translate
the
following
passage
from
prof
baschs
book
alluded
to
above
there
is
nothing
more
disconcerting
than
the
first
approach
to
this
strange
work
stirner
does
not
condescend
to
inform
us
as
to
the
architecture
of
his
edifice
or
furnish
us
the
slightest
guiding
thread
the
apparent
divisions
of
the
book
are
few
and
misleading
from
the
first
page
to
the
last
a
unique
thought
circulates
but
it
divides
itself
among
an
infinity
of
vessels
and
arteries
in
each
of
which
runs
a
blood
so
rich
in
ferments
that
one
is
tempted
to
describe
them
all
there
is
no
progress
in
the
development
and
the
repetitions
are
innumerable
the
reader
who
is
not
deterred
by
this
oddity
or
rather
absence
of
composition
gives
proof
of
genuine
intellectual
courage
at
first
one
seems
to
be
confronted
with
a
collection
of
essays
strung
together
with
a
throng
of
aphorisms
but
if
you
read
this
book
several
times
if
after
having
penetrated
the
intimacy
of
each
of
its
parts
you
then
traverse
it
as
a
whole
q
gradually
the
fragments
weld
themselves
together
and
stirners
thought
is
revealed
in
all
its
unity
in
all
its
force
and
in
all
its
depth
a
word
about
the
dedication
mackays
investigations
have
brought
to
light
that
marie
d
was
unworthy
of
the
honour
conferred
upon
her
she
was
no
eigene
i
therefore
reproduce
the
dedication
merely
in
the
interest
of
historical
accuracy
happy
as
i
am
in
the
appearance
of
this
book
my
joy
is
not
unmixed
with
sorrow
the
cherished
project
was
as
dear
to
the
heart
of
dr
walker
as
to
mine
and
i
deeply
grieve
that
he
is
no
longer
with
us
to
share
our
delight
in
the
fruition
nothing
however
can
rob
us
of
the
masterly
introduction
that
he
wrote
for
this
volume
in

or
perhaps
earlier
from
which
i
will
not
longer
keep
the

fifty
years
sooner
or
later
can
make
little
difference
in
the
case
of
a
book
so
revolutionary
as
this
it
saw
the
light
when
a
so
called
revolutionary
movement
was
preparing
in
mens
minds
which
agitation
was
however
only
a
disturbance
due
to
desires
to
participate
in
government
and
to
govern
and
to
be
governed
in
a
manner
different
to
that
which
prevails
the
revolutionists
of

were
bewitched
with
an
idea
they
were
not
at
all
the
masters
of
ideas
most
of
those
who
since
that
time
have
prided
themselves
upon
being
revolutionists
have
been
and
are
likewise
but
the
bondmen
of
an
idea
q
that
of
the
different
lodgment
of
authority
the
temptation
is
of
course
present
to
attempt
an
explanation
of
the
central
thought
of
this
work
but
such
an
effort
appears
to
be
unnecessary
to
one
who
has
the
volume
in
his
hand
the
authors
care
in
illustrating
his
meaning
shows
that
he
realized
how
prone
the
possessed
man
is
to
misunderstand
whatever
is
not
moulded
according
to
the
fashions
in
thinking
the
authors
learning
was
considerable
his
command
of
words
and
ideas
may
never
be
excelled
by
another
and
he
judged
it
needful
to
develop
his
argument
in
manifold
ways
so
those
who
enter
into
the
spirit
of
it
will
scarcely
hope
to
impress
others
with
the
same
conclusion
in
a
more
summary
manner
or
if
one
might
deem
that
possible
after
reading
stirner
still
one
cannot
think
that
it
could
be
done
so
surely
the
author
has
made
certain
work
of
it
even
though
he
has
to
wait
for
his
public
but
still
the
reception
of
the
book
by
its
critics
amply
proves
the
truth
of
the
saying
that
one
can
give
another
arguments
but
not
understanding
the
system
makers
and
system
believers
thus
far
cannot
get
it
out
of
their
heads
that
any
discourse
about
the
nature
of
an
ego
must
turn
upon
the
common
characteristics
of
egos
to
make
a
systematic
scheme
of
what
they
share
as
a
generality
the
critics
inquire
what
kind
of
man
the
author
is
talking
about
they
repeat
the
question
what
does
he
believe
in
they
fail
to
grasp
the
purport
of
the
recorded
answer
i
believe
in
myself
which
is
attributed
to
a
common
soldier
long
before
the
time
of
stirner
they
ask
what
is
the
principle
of
the
self
conscious
egoist
the
einzige
to
this
perplexity
stirner
says
change
the
question
put
who
instead
of
what
and
an
answer
can
then
be
given
by
naming
him
this
of
course
is
too
simple
for
persons
governed
by
ideas
and
for
persons
in
quest
of
new
governing
ideas
they
wish
to
classify
the
man
now
that
in
me
which
you
can
classify
is
not
my
distinguishing
self
man
is
the
horizon
or
zero
of
my
existence
as
an
individual
over
that
i
rise
as
i
can
at
least
i
am
something
more
than
man
in
general
pre
existing
worship
of
ideals
and
disrespect
for
self
had
made
of
the
ego
at
the
very
most
a
somebody
oftener
an
empty
vessel
to
be
filled
with
the
grace
or
the
leavings
of
a
tyrannous
doctrine
thus
a
nobody
stirner
dispels
the
morbid
subjection
and
recognizes
each
one
who
knows
and
feels
himself
as
his
own
property
to
be
neither
humble
nobody
nor
befogged
somebody
but
henceforth
flat
footed
and
level
headed
mr
thisbody
who
has
a
character
and
good
pleasure
of
his
own
just
as
he
has
a
name
of
his
own
the
critics
who
attacked
this
work
and
were
answered
in
the
authors
minor
writings
rescued
from
oblivion
by
john
henry
mackay
nearly
all
display
the
most
astonishing
triviality
and
impotent
malice
we
owe
to
dr
eduard
von
hartmann
the
unquestionable
service
which
he
rendered
by
directing
attention
to
this
book
in
his
philosophie
des
unbewuten
the
first
edition
of
which
was
published
in

and
in
other
writings
i
do
not
begrudge
dr
von
hartmann
the
liberty
of
criticism
which
he
used
and
i
think
the
admirers
of
stirners
teaching
must
quite
appreciate
one
thing
which
von
hartmann
did
at
a
much
later
date
in
der
eigene
of
august


there
appeared
a
letter
written
by
him
and
giving
among
other
things
certain
data
from
which
to
judge
that
when
friedrich
nietzsche
wrote
his
later
essays
nietzsche
was
not
ignorant
of
stirners
book
von
hartmann
wishes
that
stirner
had
gone
on
and
developed
his
principle
von
hartmann
suggests
that
you
and
i
are
really
the
same
spirit
looking
out
through
two
pairs
of
eyes
then
one
may
reply
i
need
not
concern
myself
about
you
for
in
myself
i
have
q
us
and
at
that
rate
von
hartmann
is
merely
accusing
himself
of
inconsistency
for
when
stirner
wrote
this
book
von
hartmanns
spirit
was
writing
it
and
it
is
just
the
pity
that
von
hartmann
in
his
present
form
does
not
indorse
what
he
said
in
the
form
of
stirner
q
that
stirner
was
different
from
any
other
man
that
his
ego
was
not
fichtes
transcendental
generality
but
this
transitory
ego
of
flesh
and
blood
it
is
not
as
a
generality
that
you
and
i
differ
but
as
a
couple
of
facts
which
are
not
to
be
reasoned
into
one
i
is
somewise
hartmann
and
thus
hartmann
is
i
but
i
am
not
hartmann
and
hartmann
is
not
q
i
neither
am
i
the
i
of
stirner
only
stirner
himself
was
stirners
i
note
how
comparatively
indifferent
a
matter
it
is
with
stirner
that
one
is
an
ego
but
how
all
important
it
is
that
one
be
a
self
conscious
ego
q
a
self
conscious
self
willed
person
those
not
self
conscious
and
self
willed
are
constantly
acting
from
self
interested
motives
but
clothing
these
in
various
garbs
watch
those
people
closely
in
the
light
of
stirners
teaching
and
they
seem
to
be
hypocrites
they
have
so
many
good
moral
and
religious
plans
of
which
self
interest
is
at
the
end
and
bottom
but
they
we
may
believe
do
not
know
that
this
is
more
than
a
coincidence
in
stirner
we
have
the
philosophical
foundation
for
political
liberty
his
interest
in
the
practical
development
of
egoism
to
the
dissolution
of
the
state
and
the
union
of
free
men
is
clear
and
pronounced
and
harmonizes
perfectly
with
the
economic
philosophy
of
josiah
warren
allowing
for
difference
of
temperament
and
language
there
is
a
substantial
agreement
between
stirner
and
proudhon
each
would
be
free
and
sees
in
every
increase
of
the
number
of
free
people
and
their
intelligence
an
auxiliary
force
against
the
oppressor
but
on
the
other
hand
will
any
one
for
a
moment
seriously
contend
that
nietzsche
and
proudhon
march
together
in
general
aim
and
tendency
q
that
they
have
anything
in
common
except
the
daring
to
profane
the
shrine
and
sepulchre
of
superstition
nietzsche
has
been
much
spoken
of
as
a
disciple
of
stirner
and
owing
to
favourable
cullings
from
nietzsches
writings
it
has
occurred
that
one
of
his
books
has
been
supposed
to
contain
more
sense
than
it
really
does
q
so
long
as
one
had
read
only
the
extracts
nietzsche
cites
scores
or
hundreds
of
authors
had
he
read
everything
and
not
read
stirner
but
nietzsche
is
as
unlike
stirner
as
a
tight
rope
performance
is
unlike
an
algebraic
equation
stirner
loved
liberty
for
himself
and
loved
to
see
any
and
all
men
and
women
taking
liberty
and
he
had
no
lust
of
power
democracy
to
him
was
sham
liberty
egoism
the
genuine
liberty
nietzsche
on
the
contrary
pours
out
his
contempt
upon
democracy
because
it
is
not
aristocratic
he
is
predatory
to
the
point
of
demanding
that
those
who
must
succumb
to
feline
rapacity
shall
be
taught
to
submit
with
resignation
when
he
speaks
of
anarchistic
dogs
scouring
the
streets
of
great
civilized
cities
it
is
true
the
context
shows
that
he
means
the
communists
but
his
worship
of
napoleon
his
bathos
of
anxiety
for
the
rise
of
an
aristocracy
that
shall
rule
europe
for
thousands
of
years
his
idea
of
treating
women
in
the
oriental
fashion
show
that
nietzsche
has
struck
out
in
a
very
old
path
q
doing
the
apotheosis
of
tyranny
we
individual
egoistic
anarchists
however
may
say
to
the
nietzsche
school
so
as
not
to
be
misunderstood
we
do
not
ask
of
the
napoleons
to
have
pity
nor
of
the
predatory
barons
to
do
justice
they
will
find
it
convenient
for
their
own
welfare
to
make
terms
with
men
who
have
learned
of
stirner
what
a
man
can
be
who
worships
nothing
bears
allegiance
to
nothing
to
nietzsches
rhodomontade
of
eagles
in
baronial
form
born
to
prey
on
industrial
lambs
we
rather
tauntingly
oppose
the
ironical
question
where
are
your
claws
what
if
the
eagles
are
found
to
be
plain
barn
yard
fowls
on
which
more
silly
fowls
have
fastened
steel
spurs
to
hack
the
victims
who
however
have
the
power
to
disarm
the
sham
eagles
between
two
suns
stirner
shows
that
men
make
their
tyrants
as
they
make
their
gods
and
his
purpose
is
to
unmake
tyrants
nietzsche
dearly
loves
a
tyrant
in
style
stirners
work
offers
the
greatest
possible
contrast
to
the
puerile
padded
phraseology
of
nietzsches
zarathustra
and
its
false
imagery
who
ever
imagined
such
an
unnatural
conjuncture
as
an
eagle
toting
a
serpent
in
friendship
which
performance
is
told
of
in
bare
words
but
nothing
comes
of
it
in
stirner
we
are
treated
to
an
enlivening
and
earnest
discussion
addressed
to
serious
minds
and
every
reader
feels
that
the
word
is
to
him
for
his
instruction
and
benefit
so
far
as
he
has
mental
independence
and
courage
to
take
it
and
use
it
the
startling
intrepidity
of
this
book
is
infused
with
a
whole
hearted
love
for
all
mankind
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
the
author
shows
not
one
iota
of
prejudice
or
any
idea
of
division
of
men
into
ranks
he
would
lay
aside
government
but
would
establish
any
regulation
deemed
convenient
and
for
this
only
our
convenience
in
consulted
thus
there
will
be
general
liberty
only
when
the
disposition
toward
tyranny
is
met
by
intelligent
opposition
that
will
no
longer
submit
to
such
a
rule
beyond
this
the
manly
sympathy
and
philosophical
bent
of
stirner
are
such
that
rulership
appears
by
contrast
a
vanity
an
infatuation
of
perverted
pride
we
know
not
whether
we
more
admire
our
author
or
more
love
him
stirners
attitude
toward
woman
is
not
special
she
is
an
individual
if
she
can
be
not
handicapped
by
anything
he
says
feels
thinks
or
plans
this
was
more
fully
exemplified
in
his
life
than
even
in
this
book
but
there
is
not
a
line
in
the
book
to
put
or
keep
woman
in
an
inferior
position
to
man
neither
is
there
anything
of
caste
or
aristocracy
in
the
book
likewise
there
is
nothing
of
obscurantism
or
affected
mysticism
about
it
everything
in
it
is
made
as
plain
as
the
author
could
make
it
he
who
does
not
so
is
not
stirners
disciple
nor
successor
nor
co
worker
some
one
may
ask
how
does
plumb
line
anarchism
train
with
the
unbridled
egoism
proclaimed
by
stirner
the
plumb
line
is
not
a
fetish
but
an
intellectual
conviction
and
egoism
is
a
universal
fact
of
animal
life
nothing
could
seem
clearer
to
my
mind
than
that
the
reality
of
egoism
must
first
come
into
the
consciousness
of
men
before
we
can
have
the
unbiased
einzige
in
place
of
the
prejudiced
biped
who
lends
himself
to
the
support
of
tyrannies
a
million
times
stronger
over
me
than
the
natural
self
interest
of
any
individual
when
plumb
line
doctrine
is
misconceived
as
duty
between
unequal
minded
men
q
as
a
religion
of
humanity
q
it
is
indeed
the
confusion
of
trying
to
read
without
knowing
the
alphabet
and
of
putting
philanthropy
in
place
of
contract
but
if
the
plumb
line
be
scientific
it
is
or
can
be
my
possession
my
property
and
i
choose
it
for
its
use
q
when
circumstances
admit
of
its
use
i
do
not
feel
bound
to
use
it
because
it
is
scientific
in
building
my
house
but
as
my
will
to
be
intelligent
is
not
to
be
merely
wilful
the
adoption
of
the
plumb
line
follows
the
discarding
of
incantations
there
is
no
plumb
line
without
the
unvarying
lead
at
the
end
of
the
line
not
a
fluttering
bird
or
a
clawing
cat
on
the
practical
side
of
the
question
of
egoism
versus
self
surrender
and
for
a
trial
of
egoism
in
politics
this
may
be
said
the
belief
that
men
not
moved
by
a
sense
of
duty
will
be
unkind
or
unjust
to
others
is
but
an
indirect
confession
that
those
who
hold
that
belief
are
greatly
interested
in
having
others
live
for
them
rather
than
for
themselves
but
i
do
not
ask
or
expect
so
much
i
am
content
if
others
individually
live
for
themselves
and
thus
cease
in
so
many
ways
to
act
in
opposition
to
my
living
for
myself
q
to
our
living
for
ourselves
if
christianity
has
failed
to
turn
the
world
from
evil
it
is
not
to
be
dreamed
that
rationalism
of
a
pious
moral
stamp
will
succeed
in
the
same
task
christianity
or
all
philanthropic
love
is
tested
in
non
resistance
it
is
a
dream
that
example
will
change
the
hearts
of
rulers
tyrants
mobs
if
the
extremest
self
surrender
fails
how
can
a
mixture
of
christian
love
and
worldly
caution
succeed
this
at
least
must
be
given
up
the
policy
of
christ
and
tolstoi
can
soon
be
tested
but
tolstois
belief
is
not
satisfied
with
a
present
test
and
failure
he
has
the
infatuation
of
one
who
persists
because
this
ought
to
be
the
egoist
who
thinks
i
should
like
this
to
be
still
has
the
sense
to
perceive
that
it
is
not
accomplished
by
the
fact
of
some
believing
and
submitting
inasmuch
as
others
are
alert
to
prey
upon
the
unresisting
the
pharaohs
we
have
ever
with
us
several
passages
in
this
most
remarkable
book
show
the
author
as
a
man
full
of
sympathy
when
we
reflect
upon
his
deliberately
expressed
opinions
and
sentiments
q
his
spurning
of
the
sense
of
moral
obligation
as
the
last
form
of
superstition
q
may
we
not
be
warranted
in
thinking
that
the
total
disappearance
of
the
sentimental
supposition
of
duty
liberates
a
quantity
of
nervous
energy
for
the
purest
generosity
and
clarifies
the
intellect
for
the
more
discriminating
choice
of
objects
of
merit

walker
preface
to
the
danish
edition
of


the
book
the
ego
and
his
own
was
published
in
leipzig
in
the
year

a
book
that
got
no
small
attention
by
its
rebellious
daringness
it
has
in
our
days
been
brought
up
and
examined
anew
as
a
precedent
to
present
individualist
or
anarchist
teaching
and
has
now
also
found
a
danish
admirer
and
translator
the
author
called
himself
max
stirner
but
his
real
name
was
johann
kaspar
schmidt
he
was
born
in
bayreuth
in

and
lived
as
a
poor
teacher
a
job
he
had
to
give
up
as
a
consequence
of
the
publishing
of
his
book
for
some
time
he
tempted
a
life
as
an
author
and
a
translator
he
died
a
forgotten
man
in
berlin
in

followers
of
friedrich
nietzsche
have
returned
to
max
stirner
driven
by
the
widespread
urge
to
find
an
ancestor
and
modern
anarchism
lays
claim
to
him
as
he
has
influenced
one
of
their
most
important
men
bakunin
max
stirner
descends
in
a
straight
line
from
the
nominalists
of
the
early
middles
ages
that
about

years
before
his
time
already
claimed
that
universals
like
those
he
fights
by
the
name
of
ghosts
man
and
mankind
in
particular
had
no
reality
of
their
own
but
were
mere
words
and
names
their
fight
continued
through
all
of
the
th
and
th
century
and
they
suffered
persecution
for
their
convictions
as
later
did
stirner
stirner
seems
to
have
been
moved
into
action
by
the
publishing
of
ludwig
feuerbachs
the
essence
of
christianity

a
book
seen
as
the
last
word
in
progressive
thought
at
the
time
in
this
book
the
most
radical
conclusions
of
the
day
were
drawn
the
book
turned
theology
upside
down
in
that
it
claimed
that
the
truth
was
revealed
by
substituting
love
is
divine
goodness
is
divine
for
god
the
divine
is
love
god
is
good
and
praising
everything
human
man
was
holy
friendship
and
marriage
were
holy
it
appeared
to
max
stirner
that
by
this
turning
upside
down
of
theology
the
basic
outlook
of
theology
was
preserved
and
he
rebelled
rightly
against
it
as
far
as
he
as
spirit
and
writer
might
have
been
inferior
to
feuerbach
in
style
he
was
nevertheless
as
an
improvement
upon
him
as
a
thinker
that
went
beyond
him
in
that
religion
of
humanity
that
feuerbach
had
left
standing
self
denial
was
hardly
less
praised
than
in
christianity
self
love
was
seen
as
the
unhuman
and
was
to
be
sacrificed
with
a
passion
that
might
have
received
its
nourishment
through
the
study
of
helvtius
and
that
precedes
nietzsche
max
stirner
fights
against
the
religiously
influenced
view
of
self
love
as
the
evil
principle
to
him
the
unique
self
is
the
only
real
self
and
thus
the
only
source
of
power
and
right
man
the
people
the
church
the
state
these
secretive
moral
or
political
persons
are
lost
personalities
asses
in
the
lion
hide
of
the
self
that
stirner
pulls
down
over
their
ears
that
i
love
myself
does
in
his
opponents
view
imply
that
i
care
only
only
for
the
sensual
self
whereas
he
claims
that
my
self
is
not
exhausted
by
my
sensuality
he
demonstrates
on
what
superstition
the
commandment
of
self
denial
can
rest
and
portrays
emphatically
the
victims
of
unnatural
abstinence
in
the
talk
of
his
opponents
he
finds
a
hidden
unconfessed
self
love
he
himself
openly
endorses
self
love
as
a
principle
and
shows
how
i
assure
my
freedom
only
through
using
what
surrounds
me
in
my
own
best
interest
like
all
thinkers
of
this
creed
he
claims
that
any
sacrifice
that
i
bring
to
my
friend
or
to
my
lover
i
do
not
bring
for
their
sake
alone
but
for
my
own
sake
as
i
cannot
stand
seeing
them
suffering
or
wanting
but
nobody
has
a
claim
to
my
love
and
love
is
no
commandment
but
a
free
service
through
which
the
i
relates
to
itself
the
philosophy
of
egoism
is
just
like
pessimism
is
a
conceptual
attempt
the
attempt
to
see
whether
we
can
attain
illumination
of
being
by
the
unique
self
it
is
worth
noticing
that
by
stirner
just
as
by
the
speculative
philosophers
the
self
never
occurs
as
a
result
a
product
but
always
as
the
ever
new
starting
point
unexplained
but
it
is
instructive
to
follow
him
when
he
rightly
shows
that
neither
does
the
discoverer
follow
his
discovery
nor
does
the
author
follow
his
fundamental
idea
of
love
of
humanity
but
do
it
solely
to
express
themselves
just
as
the
bird
sings
because
it
is
a
songbird
one
need
not
he
says
look
at
the
welfare
of
humanity
in
order
not
to
lie
and
deceive
but
might
perfectly
well
refrain
from
it
for
purely
selfish
reasons
when
he
establishes
the
principle
of
self
love
as
the
one
true
and
blessed
and
on
purpose
uses
the
offensive
expression
that
we
see
each
other
as
objects
he
probably
means
that
nobody
gives
money
or
good
will
to
that
for
which
he
has
no
use
the
north
americans
ask
themselves
do
we
require
a
king
and
answer
not
a
farthing
are
he
and
his
work
worth
to
us
and
when
he
states
that
the
egoist
does
not
expect
his
possession
by
hand
outs
but
conquers
what
is
in
his
might
in
that
all
that
he
can
appropriate
is
his
property
he
does
not
conceive
the
word
as
raw
and
pertaining
to
superficial
things
what
a
competence
he
says
does
not
the
child
possess
in
its
smiling
its
playing
its
screaming
in
short
in
its
mere
existence
are
you
capable
of
resisting
its
desire
it
is
characteristic
that
the
most
perfect
example
of
that
self
love
and
self
assertiveness
that
he
praises
he
finds
in
jesus
who
in
his
opinion
was
not
like
julius
caesar
a
mere
revolutionary
turning
over
the
state
only
to
make
room
for
a
new
one
but
was
an
insurgent
who
lifted
himself
above
everything
that
seemed
sublime
to
the
government
and
its
opponents
and
absolved
himself
from
everything
that
they
remained
bound
to
in
particular
stirner
glorifies
jesus
that
he
did
not
waste
his
power
on
turning
over
the
established
but
rather
immured
it
as
he
walled
it
in
confidently
and
recklessly
carrying
up
the
building
of
his
temple
over
it
without
heeding
the
pains
of
the
immured
he
then
of
course
suggests
that
the
christian
world
order
will
see
the
same
fate
as
once
did
the
heathen
one
self
will
as
he
portrays
it
is
by
its
being
the
corruption
of
the
state
what
his
contemporaries
desired
by
the
name
of
political
freedom
was
bondage
to
the
state
and
its
laws
none
should
according
to
their
opinion
ridicule
what
was
sacred
to
others
extramarital
sex
was
seen
as
immoral
when
only
an
impersonal
ruler
came
in
place
of
the
personal
arbitrariness
they
were
satisfied
and
they
desired
freedom
a
so
called
free
constitution
as
a
bestowal
from
the
powers
that
be
stirner
vigorously
attacks
them
you
long
for
freedom
you
fools
if
you
took
might
freedom
would
come
of
itself
i
can
have
only
so
much
freedom
as
i
procure
for
myself
it
is
not
given
to
me
and
i
let
myself
be
robbed
and
he
mocks
those
who
believe
freedom
can
be
bestowed
just
like
those
who
believe
that
right
has
no
other
base
than
might
the
tiger
that
assails
me
is
in
the
right
and
i
who
strike
him
down
am
also
in
the
right
to
him
as
later
also
to
henrik
ibsen
and
nietzsche
the
state
is
the
curse
of
the
individual
the
state
is
a
ruler
just
as
the
church
was
and
builds
its
case
on
morality
just
as
the
church
built
its
case
on
piety
the
state
does
from
the
first
moment
on
apply
the
scissors
of
state
culture
against
the
individual
and
any
creative
work
against
the
state
is
punishable
the
freer
the
people
as
such
is
said
to
be
the
stronger
the
bonds
of
the
individual
to
state
society
and
party
but
popular
freedom
was
at
that
time
a
mere
ideal
and
stirners
well
of
mockery
of
the
contemporary
political
opposition
in
germany
never
goes
dry
the
law
abiding
and
loyal
opposition
that
hold
even
the
most
wretched
laws
in
high
esteem
as
laws
and
found
whoever
tried
to
evade
censorship
to
be
immoral
against
the
socialist
opponents
of
the
state
he
affirms
that
as
society
is
capable
only
of
organizing
work
for
the
common
good
he
who
produces
something
unique
cannot
become
an
object
of
its
care
but
will
rather
be
seen
as
a
disturbing
element
he
draws
his
parallels
all
the
way
back
to
antiquity
the
athenians
were
not
socrates
judges
but
his
enemies
in
the
year

the
german
empire
celebrated
its
thousandth
anniversary
stirner
must
have
started
working
on
his
book
already
then
for
as
he
states
in
it
listen
even
as
i
am
writing
this
the
bells
begin
to
sound
that
they
may
jingle
in
for
tomorrow
the
festival
of
the
thousand
years
existence
of
our
dear
germany
sound
sound
its
knell
you
do
sound
solemn
enough
as
if
your
tongue
was
moved
by
the
presentiment
that
it
is
giving
convoy
to
a
corpse
the
people
is
dead
q
up
with
me
tomorrow
they
carry
thee
to
the
grave
soon
thy
sisters
the
peoples
will
follow
thee
but
when
they
have
all
followed
then
qq
mankind
is
buried
and
i
am
my
own
i
am
the
laughing
heir
that
close
a
victory
the
first
german
anarchist
envisioned
for
his
ideas
little
did
he
know
that

years
later
germany
would
entertain
the
idea
of
the
state
to
an
unprecedented
degree
to
the
question
what
will
happen
when
the
great
revolution
that
he
is
awaiting
comes
he
is
at
loss
for
an
answer
with
the
phrase
that
one
might
just
as
well
expect
him
to
do
the
horoscope
of
a
child
the
only
suggestions
to
be
seen
is
that
he
envisions
the
state
society
replaced
by
a
free
union
in
which
i
sacrifice
a
part
of
my
freedom
not
for
the
sake
of
others
but
for
myself
stirners
form
and
course
of
action
as
a
thinker
have
been
outdated
but
his
work
abounds
with
thoughts
that
belonged
to
the
future
some
of
which
are
already
realized
and
some
whose
realization
seem
close
at
hand
one
will
naturally
encounter
a
lot
that
will
seem
unreasonable
and
pushed
to
an
extreme
and
also
some
clear
cases
of
a
dream
of
the
past
but
all
the
more
frequently
the
modern
reader
will
run
into
stirners
clairvoyance
